<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Sailboat Church: Helping Your Church Rethink Its Mission and Practice</h2><p>Is your church a rowboat church or a sailboat church? <p>Rowboat churches depend largely on human effort. When church budgets shrink and membership declines, rowboat churches frantically row harder against a current, often frustrated and disappointed at their efforts. Sailboat churches, on the other hand, take up the oars, hoist sails, and rely on the Holy Spirit to guide them. </p><p>Arguing that churches should be "sailboats," Joan S. Gray encourages readers to shift concern from the many daily, practical concerns of their local church to fresh ideas that can be found using the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The book includes forty days of sailing prayers, quotes from Scripture, brief reflection questions, and an extensive bibliography that is arranged by theme. Perfect for groups to read together, this book will help leaders reframe their church's mission and practice with the Holy Spirit as their guide.</p></p><p>Joan S. Gray is a teaching elder living in Atlanta, Georgia. The moderator of the 217th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), she is the author or coauthor of several books including <i>Presbyterian Polity for Church Leaders, Fourth Edition</i>, with Joyce C. Tucker.</p><h2>Visions, Trips, and Crowded Rooms: Who and What You See Before You Die</h2><p>David Kessler, one of the most renowned experts on death and grief, takes on three uniquely shared experiences that challenge our ability to explain and fully understand the mystery of our final days. The first is "visions." As the dying lose sight of this world, some people appear to be looking into the world to come. The second shared experience is getting ready for a "trip." The phenomenon of preparing oneself for a journey isn&#x2019;t new or unusual. In fact, during our loved ones&#x2019; last hours, they may often think of their impending death as a transition or journey. These trips may seem to us to be all about leaving, but for the dying, they may be more about arriving. Finally, the third phenomenon is "crowded rooms." The dying often talk about seeing a room full of people, as they constantly repeat the word crowded. In truth, we never die alone. Just as loving hands greeted us when we were born, so will loving arms embrace us when we die. In the tapestry of life and death, we may begin to see connections to the past that we missed in life. While death may look like a loss to the living, the last hours of a dying person may be filled with fullness rather than emptiness. In this fascinating book, which includes a new Afterword, Kessler brings us stunning stories from the bedsides of the dying that will educate, enlighten, and comfort us all.</p><p>David Kessler is one of the most well-known experts and lecturers on death and grief. His first book, The Needs of the Dying, a #1 best-selling hospice book, received praise by Mother Teresa. His services have been used by Elizabeth Taylor, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Marianne Williamson when their loved ones faced life-challenging illnesses. He also worked with late actors Anthony Perkins and Michael Landon.Kessler&#x2019;s work has been featured on CNN, NBC, PBS, and Entertainment Tonight; and he has been interviewed on Oprah &amp; Friends. He has been discussed in The New York Times and The New Yorker, and he is a contributing writer for Oprah.com as well as an AOL.com Health Expert. He has also written for The Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Wall Street Journal, and Anderson Cooper 360ï¿½.This book shares David&#39;s wisdom and his love, and helps all of us who enter unknown waters. Louise L. Hay Extraordinary and touching...a heartwarming and life-affirming book. Kindred Spirit Magazine David Kessler writes of a world that is rarely talked about, much less examined with such sensitivity. His stories reveal dimensions of the death experience that are anything but depressing, and at times absolutely joyful. In a book filled with intriguing and inspirational tales, Kessler makes a compelling argument that death is not the end.

And as accustomed as FBI agents Eliza Sterling and Brandon Eddison are to such harrowing cases, this one has struck a nerve. It marks the anniversary of the disappearance of Eddison&#x2019;s own little sister. Disturbing, too, is the girl&#x2019;s resemblance to Eliza&#x2014;so uncanny they could be mother and daughter.</p><p>With Eddison&#x2019;s unsettled past rising again with rage and pain, Eliza is determined to solve this case at any cost. But the closer she looks, the more reluctant she is to divulge to her increasingly shaken partner what she finds. Brooklyn isn&#x2019;t the only girl of her exact description to go missing. She&#x2019;s just the latest in a frightening pattern going back decades in cities throughout the entire country.</p><p>In a race against time, Eliza&#x2019;s determined to bring Brooklyn home and somehow find the link to the cold case that has haunted Eddison&#x2014;and the entire Crimes Against Children team&#x2014;since its inception.</p></p><p><p>Dot Hutchison is the author of the Collector series (<i>The Butterfly Garden</i>, <i>The Roses of May</i>, <i>The Summer Children</i>, and <i>The Vanishing Season</i>) as well as <i>A Wounded Name</i>, a young adult novel based on Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Hamlet</i>. Hutchison loves thunderstorms, mythology, history, and movies that can and should be watched on repeat. She has a background in theater, Renaissance festival living chessboards, and free falls. She likes to think that Saint George regretted killing that dragon for the rest of his days.

Halbert, explaining insider tactics and sage wisdom to his youngest son Bond. Once only available as part of a paid monthly premium, The Boron Letters are unique in the marketing universe and now they are a bona fide cult classic among direct response marketers and copywriters around the world.

But let&#39;s admit it, they weren&#39;t exactly poster boys for corporate America. Or were they? For an extraordinary 30 years, the Dead improvised a business plan-all while making huge profits and pioneering practices subsequently embraced by the business world. Now, business professor and lifelong Deadhead Barry Barnes shares the 10 most innovative business lessons from the band&#39;s illustrious career, including: creating and delivering superior customer value; implementing a flat management structure; sharing your content; and more. Barnes shows how the Dead were masters of &#34;strategic improvisation&#34;-the ability to adapt to changing times and circumstances-and that their success lay in their commitment to relentless variation. EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT BUSINESS I LEARNED FROM THE GRATEFUL DEAD teaches readers how they did it-and what any business can learn from their long, strange trip.</p><p>Barry Barnes is a professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida."It is Barry Barnes' not-too-outrageous conceit that the Grateful Dead, a prototypical band from the era of Vietnam and shoulder-length hair, have something to say about running a business. Jerry Garcia was no mogul (a fact for which his fans will rejoice). Yet perhaps in these life's lessons the executive will learn to loosen his tie, widen his gaze, and rescue his bottom line by not, for a change, obsessing over it. I have read many business manuals. This is one of the few I will remember."&#x2015;<b>Roger Lowenstein, New York Times bestselling author of THE END OF WALL STREET</b><br><br>"Barry Barnes deftly shows how the magic and authenticity of the Grateful Dead transcends its musical prowess, providing invaluable insights into how successful organizations thrive."&#x2015;<b>William D. Cohan, New York Times bestelling author of MONEY AND POWER and HOUSE OF CARDS</b><br><br>"In <i>Everything I Know About Business I Learned From The Grateful Dead</i>, Barry Barnes deconstructs one of the most fascinating rock bands of our time and uncovers some very powerful and unexpected lessons in innovation, marketing and entrepreneurship. If you want your business to go on a long, strange trip - in the best possible way - this is the book for you."&#x2015;<b>Mitch Joel, President of Twist Image and author of Six Pixels of Separation</b><br><br>"Brisk and compelling, this overview of the Deadhead nation reads like a candid rock biography as well as an insightful business manual...Important lessons learned from a unique band of musical pioneers."&#x2015;<b>Kirkus</b></p><h2>Fly!</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Teague proves that a picture can be worth a thousand words&#x2014;and almost as many laughs.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;Engaging illustrations and the baby bird&#x2019;s wild ideas will entertain audiences of all ages.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;Funny, feathery finesse.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)</b><br> <br><b>Mama bird thinks it&#x2019;s time for Baby bird&#x2019;s first flight, but Baby bird has other ideas in this humorous wordless picture book from <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author-illustrator Mark Teague.</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s a big day up in the tree that Mama bird shares with her baby. Mama bird thinks Baby bird is finally ready to leave the nest and learn to fly so he can migrate south with the rest of their flock. But Baby bird isn&#x2019;t so sure. Can&#x2019;t his mother keep bringing him worms in their nest? Can&#x2019;t he migrate in a hot air balloon instead?

He also created the art for the How Do Dinosaurs... series. His illustrated novel, <i>The Doom Machine</i>, received excellent reviews. Mark lives in the Hudson River Valley with his wife and two daughters.Many picture books feature young birds who refuse to fly, but Teague (<i>Felipe and Claudette</i>) takes the genre to new heights with this story. Wordless it may be, but there&#x2019;s plenty of dialogue between the story&#x2019;s petulant robin fledging and its relatively patient mother, all conveyed via balloons filled with spot illustrations. The humor arises from the tension between Teague&#x2019;s elegant, substantial-looking acrylic images and the parent-offspring bickering that readers can hear instantly and vividly in their minds. When the mom communicates to her child that all birds fly, her pictorial balloon suggests a bevy of graceful, soaring species. The child&#x2019;s unflappable response? A series of illustrations show it laughingly opting instead for aerial transit via hot air balloon, hang glider, plane, and superhero cape. Countering the mother&#x2019;s suggestion that the autumn migration will require flight, the wee bird invokes the idea of a road trip via bicycle, skateboard, or red convertible. Finally, the baby bird does fly&#x2014;it takes a reminder that becoming an owl&#x2019;s dinner is a real possibility&#x2014;and the story ends with a reconciliatory cuddle that needs no further elaboration. Teague proves that a picture can be worth a thousand words&#x2014;and almost as many laughs.

Her brother, Clive Campbell, spun the records. He had a new way of playing the music to make the breaks&#x2015;the musical interludes between verses&#x2015;longer for dancing. He called himself DJ Kool Herc and this is <i>When the Beat Was Born</i>. From his childhood in Jamaica to his youth in the Bronx, Laban Carrick Hill's book tells how Kool Herc came to be a DJ, how kids in gangs stopped fighting in order to breakdance, and how the music he invented went on to define a culture and transform the world.</p></p><p><p><b>Laban Carrick Hill</b> is the author of <i>America Dreaming: How Youth Changed America in the 60s</i>, <i>Harlem Stomp!: A Cultural History of the Harlem Renaissance</i>, which was a National Book Award finalist, and <i>Dave the Potter</i>, a Caldecott Honor book, illustrated by Bryan Collier. He lives in Burlington, Vermont. </p><p><b>Theodore Taylor III</b> is an artist, designer, and photographer living in Washington, D.C. <i>When the Beat Was Born </i>is his first picture book.</p>This picture-book biography introduces one of the unsung creators of hip-hop, Clive Campbell, who was born in Jamaica in 1955. He was entranced by the massive dance parties thrown by a neighbor, and when his family moved to the Bronx, he took up the name Kool Herc and created the innovative techniques behind hip-hop DJing. Stacking musical breaks on top of each other to fuel long stretches of dancing frenzy, calling the kids with the best moves &#x201c;break-dancers,&#x201d; and sending shout-outs to friends and little offhand rhymes over the music&#x2014;Kool Herc unique and hip-hop wouldn&#x2019;t exist without any one of these flashes of inspiration. By the time rap music really took off, in the early 1980s, he was already out of the limelight but not without leaving a massive legacy. Aside from the bouncy bio of the book&#x2019;s star, Hill also highlights the positive social force of hip-hop and the boundless energy of musical joy. It&#x2019;s all matched by Taylor&#x2019;s freewheeling artwork. A treat from an underrepresented corner of music history.

In particular, his residential work has been the subject of continuing interest and controversy. Wright&#39;s Fallingwater (1935), the seminal masterpiece perched over a waterfall deep in the Pennsylvania highlands, is perhaps the best-known private house in the history of the world. In fact, Wright&#39;s houses-from his Prairie style Robie House (1906) in Chicago, to the Storer (1923) and Freeman (1923) houses in Los Angeles, and Taliesen West (1937) in the Arizona desert-are all touchstones of modern architecture. For the first time, all 289 extant houses are shown here in exquisite color photographs. Along with Weintraub&#39;s stunning photos and a selection of floor plans and archival images, the book includes text and essays by several leading Wright scholars. Frank Lloyd Wright: The Houses is an event of great importance and a major contribution to the literature on this titan of modern architecture.</p><p>Alan Weintraub is an architectural photographer whose recent work includes Bay Area Style.

And how can one short term mission team prepare so diligently for the practical ministry they&#39;ll be doing and be so ineffective as a group, while another team that seems less polished or skilled makes a huge mark in the culture they visit? Could it be that the heart preparation is more important than it is given credit for? In &#34;Before You Go,&#34; experienced short term mission leader and trainer Jack Hempfling takes you on a 40 day journey that will bring you face to face with attitudes and issues that if not addressed, can make you or your group ineffective on the field.

Without your even being aware of the connection to the above issues, it has created additional life-long challenges such as endless guilt, anxiety, perfectionism, need to control, depression, a history of dysfunctional relationships and much more. This easy to understand, interactive book will reveal how codependency has sobotaged you, the lies it created in your beliefs and the truths that expose them. Also included is a Guide to Recovery using simple acts of mindfulness to overcome harmful habits in your thinking, actions and choices that are keeping you from having peace. Once you understand you are not crazy, just coping with the deep-seated effects of codependency, you will be free to create the life you were always meant to have.</p><p>Jeanette Elisabeth Menter is a former newspaper columnist, freelance magazine writer and Christian Lay Counselor. She began her writing career at the age of sixteen. Her interest in codependency is based in her own experiences. Having had to live through a childhood filled with addiction, abuse, ongoing shame as a way of control and more, she knows what readers are dealing with. &#x201c;I had the very real need to share what I have learned along the way about this dibilitating problem. I present codependency in a whole new light and believe that anyone who commits to what is laid out in this book will see positive changes in their lives.&#x201d; Born in Munich, Germany, she was raised in Ohio. At the age of twenty-two she bought a one-way train ticket to California to escape a violent relationship. She spent the next 28 years there and had an successful advertising career for over twenty years. Yet inside she was still battling the demons of codependency. In 2007 she received her Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree (Cum Laude) from Indiana Wesleyan University with a focus on communications. She and her husband, John moved to Las Vegas in 2012 to be nearer to their grown children in California. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing how many people still don&#x2019;t understand codependency, even when it is consuming them and those they love. The need to fix others is always easier than accepting we are codependent and need help.&#x201d; "You&#x2019;re Not Crazy-You&#x2019;re Codependent" is Jeanette Menter&#x2019;s first book. "Like addiction, once a codependent, always a codependent.

At his Los Angeles restaurant, Crossroads, the menu is vegan, but there are no soybeans or bland seitan to be found. He and his executive chef, Scot Jones, turn seasonal vegetables, beans, nuts, and grains into sophisticated Mediterranean fare&#x2014;think warm bowls of tomato-sauced pappardelle, plates of spicy carrot salad, and crunchy flatbreads piled high with roasted vegetables. In <i>Crossroads,</i> an IACP Cookbook Award finalist, Ronnen teaches readers to make his recipes and proves that the flavors we crave are easily replicated in dishes made without animal products. With accessible, unfussy recipes, <i>Crossroads</i> takes plant-based eating firmly out of the realm of hippie health food and into a cuisine that fits perfectly with today&#x2019;s modern palate. The recipes are photographed in sumptuous detail, and with more than 100 of them for weeknight dinners, snacks and appetizers, special occasion meals, desserts, and more, this book is an indispensable resource for healthy, mindful eaters everywhere.</p><p>Tal Ronnen, founder and chef of Crossroads Kitchen in Los Angeles and author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>The Conscious Cook,</i>&nbsp;became known nationwide as the chef who prepared the meals for Oprah Winfrey&#x2019;s 21-day vegan cleanse.

And then you realize he&#x2019;s vegan, an approach to eating that too often has been defined by foods so virtuous they taste worse than the packaging they come in. Except that&#x2019;s not Ronnen&#x2019;s game. For him, it doesn&#x2019;t matter if the food is raw, organic, vegetarian, vegan, local, gluten-free, animal-free, free range or free spirit. If it doesn&#x2019;t taste great, he isn&#x2019;t interested. . . . His main courses center around vegetables that aren&#x2019;t disguised as burgers or steaks or other meaty dishes.

Expect to see plenty of healthy pantry staples (e.g., agave nectar, agar-agar, arrowroot powder, almond milk) within these recipes. ï¿½VERDICT Vegan cooking taken to a new level of refinement. Epicures and professionals should take note.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review</b><br><br> &#x201c;In his second vegan cookbook (after <i>The Conscious Cook</i>), Crossroads founder and chef Ronnen tackles such issues as sustainabilty, health, and taste. With so many ways to approach plant-based food, the theme of Mediterranean flavor is employed to tie together all of the recipes packed into these pages. This book wonderfully includes all types of recipes, from quick snacks to full meals. The varieties of preparations and flavors include pistachio-kalamata tapenade in the spreads section, charred okra flatbread with sweet corn puree and cherry tomatoes, a small-plate dish consisting of fig caponata with polenta fries, and oat Florentine cookies with mocha chocolate. There is also a small section on pantry staples, such as almond-based Greek yogurt and demi-glace, that go well with nearly any vegetable.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</b><br><br> &#x201c;Though at least one vegan cookbook arrives at my door every week, I&#x2019;ve never been intrigued enough to review any of them. Then <i>Crossroads</i> arrived, and my vegan-avoidance vanished. Chef and author Tal Ronnen is a classically trained pro who cooks Mediterranean food that&#x2019;s all plant-based and all wonderful&#x2014;robust, textured and flavorful enough to satisfy the cravings of carnivores and omnivores. His cooking is not about finding substitutes for meat, but about creating exciting vegetable-centric dishes that will never elicit an exasperated &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the beef?&#x201d; Ronnen&#x2019;s recipes are not quick fixes, but they are truly worth the extra time and thought. Some are right for casual weeknights, some for weekend dinner parties. No-hassle Pickled Vegetables are great anytime, while Leek Pï¿½tï¿½ with Lentil Skillet Bread is a grand starter for a grand dinner. I could eat fabulous Fig Caponata with Polenta Fries every day, not to mention meaty Fried Oyster Mushrooms and herb ricotta (made from almonds) stuffed Cappellacci with vibrant Spinach Cream Sauce. Finish up with a divinely Decadent Dark Chocolate Cake.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;BookPage</b><br><br> &#x201c;Tal Ronnen's food is terrific. Delicious, nourishing, and plant-based, it can change your whole approach to eating healthy.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;President Bill Clinton</b><br><br> &#x201c;Tal Ronnen is a magician&#x2014;every time I eat his food, I find myself wanting more and more, and I never miss the butter or bacon fat.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Michael Voltaggio, chef and owner, ink.</b><br><br> &#x201c;Tal Ronnen understands the value of great-tasting, nutritious plant-based dishes in today&#x2019;s world.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Sir Paul McCartney</b><br><br> &#x201c;Tal Ronnen is a plant-based food whisperer, and now with this book, he and Scot Jones allow us to understand the message. In a world where it&#x2019;s becoming more and more unrealistic to raise animals for food, it&#x2019;s time to listen to what the plants are telling us and cook some of these awesome creations.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Roy Choi, chef and author of L.A. Son</b><br><br> &#x201c;Chefs Tal Ronnen and Scot Jones are artists of the highest order. The details that separate us. Whether a dish is vegan or not, disappears in the hands of a true artist.

Anett and her parents are hiding a Jewish woman and her son, Carl, in their cellar until a fishing boat can take them across the sound to neutral Sweden. The soldiers patrolling their street are growing suspicious, so Carl and his mama must make their way to the harbor despite a cloudy sky with no moon to guide them. Worried about their safety, Anett devises a clever and unusual plan for their safe passage to the harbor.<br> <br> Based on a true story.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jennifer Elvgren</strong>, award-winning author of <em>The Whispering Town </em>and <em>Josias, Hold the Book</em>, is a former print journalist who finds her story ideas in real life. She lives in Albemarle County, Virginia. With her husband, three children Caspian the border collie, Copperfield the foxhound, and Goodnight Moon the American quarter horse.</p>*Starred Review* Based on a true incident, this is the story of two families, one Danish, the other Jewish. Young Anett is told by her mother, there are new friends in the cellar. This is no surprise to the girl; the cellar is where Danish Jews are hidden from the Nazis. The new boy, Carl, and his mother are to remain hidden for two nights, until a boat can take them to Sweden. Until then the other villagers provide bread and eggs and even books. The moonless nights make it difficult to evacuate the duo, yet as the Nazis come closer, it becomes clear that they must somehow make their way to the harbor. Then Anett has an idea. That night, the villagers stand in the doorways of their houses, each whispering, this way, and forming a chain that leads Carl and his mother to the first step toward safety. The illustrations have the bold look of a graphic novel and use oversize figures to command attention. Both author and illustrator do an excellent job of bringing both the horror and humanity of this story to a level younger children can understand, and there is much of both: Nazis pounding on doors; Carl giving Anett his most prized possession, a heart-shaped stone, a last gift from his father. An unusual and strong addition to Holocaust literature.

Toler credits her mother&#x2019;s rules&#x201d; for life a life that saw her grow up the daughter of a poor teen mother and endure a husband who suffered mental illness and alcoholism with providing the grounding for her own success and happiness. Toler shows how the mindset of a black woman who knew how to make things work&#x201d; taught her the power of knowing how to manage one&#x2019;s emotional business lessons that this book offers in wrenching stories written in spare and graceful prose. My Mother&#x2019;s Rules is an unforgettable book that will captivate readers with its illustrations of how to rise above the most difficult circumstances and find peace and success in life.</p><p>Lynn Toler received her BA from Harvard and her JD from the University of Pennsylvania before spending ten years as a practicing attorney, and then seven years as administrative judge of Cleveland Heights Municipal Court. In 2001, she hosted the TV show Power of Attorney, and beginning September 2006, she is the new star of the syndicated hit Divorce Court.Easy-reading prose and a no-nonsense approach will carry readers through this collection of anecdotes and rules for healthier living from first time author and Divorce Court star/judge Toler. As the title implies, Toler draws heavily on lessons learned from her mother, some of which, such as the revelation that Toler's mother "lies, both often and well, if she feels the truth will get in someone's way," will surprise. And while the stories of Toler's upbringing have their merit, the book's strength lies in the sober, no-nonsense advice: "The Peanut Gallery Rule" asks whether "you would still be doing what you're doing if other folks could see," while Toler's suggestion to "Globalize Your Pain Quotient" makes most quotidian frustrations seem petty. The rules, many of which are accompanied by their own mini-vignette, are explained at the end of each thematic chapter and are all re-listed at the end of the book for easy browsing. Readers looking for real-world direction could do much worse. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

SOG&#39;s chain of command for missions and after-action reports extended to the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Small Green Beret-lead teams ran missions into Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam without assistance from conventional artillery, tank or infantry units. Once on the ground, their sole support was provided by Air Force Tactical Air and helicopter units, U.S. Army and Marine helicopter aviation personnel and aircrews, and from the South Vietnam Air Force&#39;s 219th Special Operations Squadron, code named Kingbees. In Laos, the communists dedicated 50,000 troops to the Ho Chi Minh Trail, including highly trained sappers from the 305th Sapper Battalion, its sole mission: attack SOG teams.</p><p><p>JOHN STRYKER MEYER</p> <p>Born Jan. 19, 1946, John Stryker Meyer entered the Army Dec. 1, 1966.

He could make her laugh and forget her problems. She could tease him about his many romantic entanglements. The last thing Cyn expected was to find herself longing for a man who could never settle down.</p><p>Sandra Brown is the author of more than fifty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, with over seventy million copies of her books in print. She and her family divide their time between South Carolina and Texas.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>Raisins, Cyn McCall realized, were actually nasty-looking things.<br><br>"Brandon, please."<br><br>"I like to do 'em this way, Mom, 'cause then you get to save 'em for last."<br><br>Cyn shook her head and sighed with resignation. Her mother heard the sigh as she entered the sunny kitchen. "What's going on? What are you frowning at, Cynthia?" Ladonia headed straight for the coffeepot and poured herself a cup.<br><br>"Your grandson is picking the raisins out of his bran flakes and lining them up around the rim of the cereal bowl."<br><br>"How creative!"<br><br>Cyn glared first at her mother, then at the puddle of milk that each misplaced raisin was dripping onto the table. "I was trying to correct him, Mother, not commend his creativity."<br><br>"Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed? Again?" Her pause between the two questions wasn't accidental. It was Ladonia Patterson's subtle way of saying that her daughter's sour moods were recurring with unpleasant frequency.<br><br>Cyn pretended not to catch the gibe as she blotted up milk with a dishcloth. "Eat your toast, Brandon."<br><br>"Can I take it in the den and eat it while I watch Sesame Street?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"No."<br><br>The divergent responses were spoken in unison. "Mother, you know I've told him&#x2014;"<br><br>"I want to talk to you, Cynthia. Alone." Ladonia helped four-year-old Brandon from his chair and wrapped the slice of cinnamon toast in a napkin. "Don't drop crumbs." She patted the seat of his pajamas as she ushered him through the door, then turned to confront her daughter. However Cyn got in the opening salvo.<br><br>"This constant interference when I'm trying to discipline Brandon has got to stop, Mother."<br><br>"That's not what this is about." Ladonia, slender, attractive, and fresh from her morning shower, squared off against her daughter across the breakfast table.<br><br>Cyn didn't welcome the imminent parental lecture, but she could smell one brewing as well as she could smell the coffee. She gave her wristwatch a cursory glance. "I've got to leave or I'll be late for work."<br><br>"Sit down."<br><br>"I don't want to start the day with an argument."<br><br>"Sit down," Ladonia repeated calmly. Cyn dropped into a chair. "More coffee?"<br><br>"No, thank you."<br><br>"You're not yourself, Cynthia," Ladonia began once she had sat down across from her daughter with a fresh mug of coffee. "You're uptight, edgy, out-of-sorts, impatient with Brandon. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were pregnant."<br><br>Cyn rolled her eyes. "Put your mind to rest on that score."<br><br>"What happened to your sense of humor? What's wrong with you lately?"<br><br>"Nothing."<br><br>"All right, I'll tell you."<br><br>"I thought you would."<br><br>"Don't get smart with me," Ladonia admonished, shaking her finger at Cyn.<br><br>"Mother, let's not repeat this conversation this morning. I already know what you're going to say."<br><br>"What am I going to say?"<br><br>"That I'm not living a well-rounded life. That Tim's been dead for two years, but I'm still alive, still young, with years of living to look forward to. That I have a wonderful job that I'm very good at, but that work isn't everything. That I need to cultivate outside interests and new friendships. That I need to get out, mingle with people my own age, join a single parents' club." She gave her mother a rueful smile. "See? I know it all by heart."<br><br>"Then why aren't you doing some of those things?"<br><br>"Because they're what you want. Not what I want."<br><br>Ladonia folded her arms on the table and leaned forward. "What do you want?"<br><br>"I don't know. I want . . ."<br><br>What? Cyn searched for an explanation for her blues. The element missing from her life wasn't so easy to peg. If she knew what it was, she would have filled the void a long time ago. For months now she had felt as though she were operating in a vacuum.<br><br>Brandon was no longer an infant who needed her constant nurturing. She felt ineffectual at work. Since moving in with them upon the death of Cyn's father, Ladonia had assumed most of the housekeeping chores. Cyn was the official head of the household, but the title didn't amount to much.<br><br>Nothing in her life produced a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction. Her youth and vitality were being drained by monotony.<br><br>"I want something to happen," she said at last, "something that will shake things up, turn my life around."<br><br>"Be careful what you wish for," Ladonia softly advised her.<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>"Tim's accidental death certainly shook things up."<br><br>Cyn was out of her chair like a shot. "That was a horrible thing to say." She snatched up her handbag, briefcase, and keys and yanked open the back door.<br><br>"Perhaps it was, Cyn. I didn't mean to sound insensitive. But if you want things to change for the better, you can't sit around relying on fate to shake things up for you. You've got to make a few changes yourself."<br><br>To that, Cyn offered no reply. "The traffic on North Central will be a nightmare, since I'm leaving so late. Tell Brandon I'll call him on my lunch break." Armored in righteous indignation, Cyn left for the hospital.<br><br>"I know that's what I said, George, but that was yesterday. Who could have guessed that they'd go public before&#x2014;"<br><br>Worth Lansing signaled his assistant to pour him another cup of coffee. Her duties extended beyond clerical ones. Mrs. Hardiman was his secretary, assistant, mother, and pal&#x2014;whatever the occasion called for. She was excellent in all capacities.<br><br>"I know that's my job, George, but you haven't lost&#x2014;"<br><br>As his client ranted on, Worth held the telephone receiver against his chest. "Any other calls come in?" he asked Mrs. Hardiman, who was now watering the plants decorating his twelfth-floor executive office.<br><br>"Only from your dentist."<br><br>"What'd he want? I just saw him last week."<br><br>"Um-huh. He looked over your X-rays and you need two fillings."<br><br>"Great, great." Worth expelled a long breath. "Got any more good news? You're sure Greta hasn't called?"<br><br>"Positive." She replaced the brass watering can in the cabinet beneath the wet bar.<br><br>"Well, when she does call, interrupt me," Worth told her, winking suggestively. "No matter what." She tsked him as she left the inner office.<br><br>Worth replaced the receiver against his ear. His client was still cursing the unpredictability of the stock market.<br><br>"George, calm down. It wasn't the right stock for you, that's all. Let me do some creative thinking here and get back to you before the market closes today. I've got a hatful of rabbits. I'm sure I can pull one out."<br><br>After he hung up, Worth left his red leather desk chair, consulted the TV monitor, which was constantly tuned to the stock-market channel, and picked up a scaled-down basketball. He shot it toward the goal mounted on the back of his office door. He missed.<br><br>No wonder; he was out of practice. It had been such a hellish week, he hadn't gone to the gym once, something he usually did religiously every day. This afternoon, he promised himself, before meeting Greta, he would treat his body to a hard, sweaty workout. He needed to be in prime condition for the coming weekend.<br><br>The information crawling across the lower third of the TV screen was getting more depressing by the second. He was still trying to decide what form that rabbit he had promised George was going to take, and desultorily throwing darts at the target across the room, when Mrs. Hardiman paged him on the intercom.<br><br>"Greta?" he asked hopefully.<br><br>"No, your lunch date just canceled."<br><br>"Damn. That old broad has got money coming out the kazoo," he muttered.<br><br>"I rescheduled for next Wednesday. Is that all right?"<br><br>"Sure, but I was counting on her fat portfolio to take up the slack this week."<br><br>"Do you want the sandwich shop downstairs to send up something for lunch?"<br><br>"Rare roast beef on whole wheat. Lots of German mustard."<br><br>Worth made a few calls, shot a few baskets, threw a few darts, putted a few golf balls, consoled the clients who had lost money that day, congratulated those who had made some. The market closed before he was able to unload George's stock onto another sucker. He promised his unhappy client that he'd take care of it first thing Monday morning.<br><br>When the phone rang again, he lunged for it. "Yes?"<br><br>"They've already sold out of roast beef," Mrs. Hardiman informed him.<br><br>"To hell with it. I'll skip lunch." As he slammed the phone down, he asked the four black-lacquered walls, "Will this day never end?"<br><br>"Hi. Where've you been keeping yourself?"<br><br>Cyn's flagging spirits sank even lower as the doctor joined her in the elevator. She'd been dodging him the last couple of weeks. Most women, no matter their marital status, would consider her crazy for avoiding Dr. Josh Masters. He was good-looking, charming, and had one of the most lucrative ob/gyn practices in Dallas. He had delivered more babies in the last calendar year than any other obstetrician in the city.<br><br>More attractive than his other attributes was the fact that he was single and rich.<br><br>"Hi, Josh." She smiled up at him, but took a cautionary step backward. As close as he was standing to her, one would think the elevator was crowded, when actually they were the only two in it.<br><br>"Been avoiding me on purpose?" he asked, cutting straight to the heart of the matter.<br><br>"I've been awfully busy."<br><br>"Too busy to return my calls?"<br><br>"As I said," she repeated a shade testily, "I've been busy." She would never have wounded someone with a broken heart. Such wasn't the case with Dr. Masters. He suffered only from a bruised ego.<br><br>However, it had amazing recuperative properties. Undaunted, he asked, "How about dinner?"<br><br>Maneuvering around that, she switched subjects. "Listen, Josh, did you see that referral I sent you? Darlene Dawson?"<br><br>"I saw her yesterday."<br><br>"Thanks for taking her as a patient even though she can't pay. I would have sent her to the free clinic, but I'm afraid there might be complications with this pregnancy."<br><br>"According to her chart, she's already had two abortions."<br><br>"That's right." Cyn sadly shook her head over the plight of the unwed seventeen-year-old she had counseled. "She wants to have this baby and give it up for adoption."<br><br>"And you wanted her to have the best care." He leaned forward, trapping her in the corner of the elevator. "But delivering healthy babies isn't the only thing I do well, Cyn."<br><br>Dr. Josh Masters did not lack self-confidence. "Well, we're here." As the doors slid open, she edged past him and stepped out of the elevator.<br><br>"Wait a sec." He charged after her, caught her arm, and drew her aside, out of the flow of traffic on the ground floor of the women's hospital. Cyn's bailiwick was dealing with women who were seeking options to unwanted pregnancies.<br><br>She hadn't utilized her master's degree in psychology until after she was widowed. Marriage had come close on the heels of college, and Brandon soon after that. Within months of Tim's death, everyone had urged her to accept the job at the clinic, but, feeling unqualified, she had done so with reservations.<br><br>The hospital staff and the social workers who referred clients to her were enormously pleased with her work. She alone thought she was inept. Most of the cases she dealt with left her feeling depressed and ineffectual.<br><br>"You didn't answer my question," Josh reminded her now.<br><br>"What question?"<br><br>"How about dinner tonight?" He flashed her the smile that a cosmetic dentist had perfected for him.<br><br>"Tonight? Oh, I can't tonight, Josh. I left the house in a hurry this morning without spending any time with Brandon. I promised to do something with him this evening."<br><br>"Tomorrow night?"<br><br>"What is tomorrow? Friday? Well, I don't know, Josh. Let me think about it. I&#x2014;"<br><br>"What gives with you?" He propped his hands on his hips and looked down at her with exasperation.<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>"We had a couple of dates. Everything was going great, then you started stringing me along."<br><br>Cyn, taking umbrage, shook her shoulder-length hair away from her face. "I've done no such thing."<br><br>"Then go out with me again."<br><br>"I told you I'd think about it."<br><br>"You've had weeks to think about it."<br><br>"And I still haven't made up my mind," she shot back.<br><br>Encircling her arm with a caressing hand, Josh switched tactics. "Cyn, Cyn, look, we're grownups, aren't we? We're supposed to act like grown-ups. We're supposed to go out, enjoy each other's company&#x2014;"<br><br>"Sleep together?"<br><br>His eyelids lowered lazily. "Sounds good to me." He used the seductive tone of voice that kept the nursing staff of the hospital, and many of his patients, aflutter.<br><br>Cyn withdrew her arm from his grasp. "Good night, Josh."<br><br>"That's it, isn't it?" he asked, falling into step with her. "The sex."<br><br>"What sex?"<br><br>"In our case, none. You're afraid of it."<br><br>"Hardly."<br><br>"You won't even talk about it."<br><br>"I talk about sex all day long."<br><br>Keeping his voice low, he stayed even with her as she exited the building and headed for the parking lot. "You can talk about it, but can't handle it when it comes around to you personally."<br><br>"I said good night."<br><br>"Come on, Cyn." He reached for her arm again, but she shrugged off his touch. "See? You get uptight if a man so much as lays a hand on you," he shouted after her as she hurried toward her car. "If the package isn't for sale, stop advertising it!"<br><br>By the time she left the parking lot, her hands had stopped shaking, but she was still seething. The doctor's ego was monstrous and insufferable. How dare he say those things to her just because she hadn't let their few dinner dates develop into sleepovers?<br><br>Stopping for the long traffic light at one of the city's infamously congested intersections, she propped her forehead on the backs of her hands while they moistly gripped the steering wheel. Maybe Josh was right. Maybe she was uptight about sex. Her healthy hormones hadn't been embalmed along with Tim, but she didn't relish sating them with just any man-on-the-make either.

Her daily tweets about <i>memento mori</i> - Latin for "remember your death" - contained quotes and insights that have inspired others to remember death daily. Many have found this ancient practice to provide an important perspective on their lives in view of Jesus' call to repentance, conversion, and the hope of resurrection. <br><br>And now Sr. Theresa Aletheia's series of tweets has led to a <i>memento mori</i>-inspired Lenten devotional. Each day contains a refection written by Sr. Theresa Aletheia based on the liturgy of the day for all of Lent, Holy Week, and Easter. The devotional also includes a memento mori examen or review of the day, a daily moment of intercessory prayer, and daily reflections on death from the tradition, including the Church Fathers and many of the saints. Prompts are provided for journaling that can be used along with the Remember Your Death: Memento Mori Journal, also available from Pauline Books. <br><br>Lent is a time when we remember the death of Christ and the sacrifice he made to give us eternal life. This devotional will help you to meditate on your own mortality and the incredible gift of salvation in preparation for Easter. Whether you get a skull for your desk, a <i>memento mori</i> journal, or a Lenten devotional, it is vitally important to the Christian life to remember the fragility of your life on earth - because one day you will die.</p><p>Sr. Theresa Aletheia Noble, FSP&nbsp;has a skull on her desk as a&nbsp;<i>memento mori</i>, a reminder of her inevitable death.&nbsp;The&nbsp;ancient tradition of remembering death--encouraged by Scripture, early Church Fathers, and many saints--has changed her life and led to greater union with God.

He&#x2019;s a KGB-trained assassin who&#x2019;s left a trail of dead British Secret Service agents in his wake. His weapon of choice? A gold-plated Colt .45.</p><p>In the aftermath of his brainwashing by the Soviets, Bond is given one last chance to win back M&#x2019;s trust: terminate Scaramanga before he strikes MI6 again. Traveling to Jamaica under an assumed name, Bond manages to infiltrate Scaramanga&#x2019;s organization and soon discovers that the hit man&#x2019;s criminal ambitions have expanded to include arson, drug smuggling, and industrial sabotage. Worst of all for Bond, Scaramanga has a golden bullet inscribed with the numbers <i>007</i>&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s eager to put it to use. </p><p>Under the heat of the Caribbean sun, Bond faces a seemingly impossible task: win a duel against the Man with the Golden Gun.</p><p><b>The text in this edition has been restored by the Fleming family company Ian Fleming Publications, to reflect the work as it was originally published.</b></p><p><b>www.ianfleming.com </b></p></p><p>Ian Fleming was born in London on May 28, 1908. He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p><b>1. 'CAN I HELP YOU?'</b></p> <p>The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organisation. Only M and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as 'The War Book' so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors.</p> <p>One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn't know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise - drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p> <p>On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cog-wheels in motion.</p> <p>The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to 'Hold' and said to her neighbour, 'It's another nut who says he's James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M personally.'</p> <p>The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond's death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the Press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond from Uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, 'Put him through to Liaison, Pat.'</p> <p>The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: 'Just a moment, sir. I'll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.'</p> <p>James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming 'Colonel Boris' who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man's voice came on the line. 'Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?'</p> <p>James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. 'This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M, or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.'</p> <p>Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, 'I'm afraid I don't know either of these two people. Are you sure you've got the right number?'</p> <p>James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director.</p> <p>'Yes,' said Captain Walker sympathetically. 'We seem to have got that part of it right. But I'm afraid I can't place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr Em, for instance. I don't think we've got anyone of that name at the Ministry.'</p> <p>'Do you want me to spell it out? You realise this is an open line?'</p> <p>Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker's voice. He pressed another button and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, 'Hang on a moment, would you? There's someone on my other line.' Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. ' Sorry, sir. I've got a chap on who says he's James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I've gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.'</p> <p>Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said 'Blast!' and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now 'live' to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself 'James Bond'. Captain Walker's voice came over at full strength. 'I'm sorry. Now then. This man Mr Em you want to talk to. I'm sure we needn't worry about security. Could you be more specific?'</p> <p>James Bond frowned. He didn't know that he had frowned and he wouldn't have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, 'Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff's name? No? Well let's see, it's Wednesday. Shall I tell you what'll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.'</p> <p>The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond,' Damn! There's the other telephone again. Shan't be a minute.' He picked up the green telephone. 'Yes, sir?' '</p> <p>I don't like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007's death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The Stone Face act. It's just possible. Keep me informed, would you?'</p> <p>Captain Walker got back to James Bond. 'Sorry about that. It's being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can't help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It's No. 44 Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I'll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?'</p> <p>James Bond said dully, 'That's very kind of you.' He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p> <p>James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond's file in the KGB Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the KGB image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the news stand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and, in due course, the same van followed Bond's taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p> <p>No. 44 Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organisation, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior.</p> <p>'Appointment with Major Townsend,' said Bond.</p> <p>'Yes. He's expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?' The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coathanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely doseted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. 'Would you follow me, sir?'</p> <p>It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the Fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended in two facing doors marked 'A' and 'B'. The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, very light room, dose-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames - one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfort-able club chain on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p> <p>This was the Soft Man.</p> <p>'Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.'</p> <p>Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark - a reference to Bond's liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond's apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight Major Townsend said, 'Well now. How can I help you?'</p> <p>Across the corridor, in Room A, a cold Office-of-Works cube with no furnitu...</p></p><h2>You Are the Girl for the Job: Daring to Believe the God Who Calls You</h2><p><p><strong>You believe (or want to believe) God has called you and given you purpose, but where do you start?

Down South, they don't forget you when you've up and died--in fact, they visit you more often. But there are quintessential rules and rituals for kicking the bucket tastefully. Having a flawless funeral is one of them.<br><br>In this deliciously entertaining slice of Southern life (and death), inveterate hostess Gayden Metcalfe explains everything you need to know to host an authentic Southern funeral. Can you be properly buried without tomato aspic? Who prepares tastier funeral fare, the Episcopal ladies or the Methodist ladies? And what does one do when a family gets three sheets to the wind and eats the entire feast the night before a funeral?<br><br>Each chapter includes a delicious, tried-and-true Southern recipe, critical if you plan to die tastefully any time soon. Pickled Shrimp, Aunt Hebe's Coconut Cake, and the ubiquitous Bing Cherry Salad with Coca-Cola are among the many dishes guaranteed to make the next funeral the most satisfying one yet.<br><br>Even if you've never been south of Rochester, this book will charm, it will entertain, and it will give you all the ingredients required for the perfect Southern send-off.</p><p><strong>Gayden Metcalfe</strong> is a lifelong Southerner and founder of the Greenville Arts Council. She lives in Greenville, Mississippi, with her husband, Harley Metcalfe III.<br><br> <strong>Charlotte Hays</strong> is a Delta native and recovering gossip columnist living in Washington, D.C.If you want a good laugh in this uptight, power-obsessed city, pick up a copy of Being Dead Is No Excuse. And if you are a Southerner, you will laugh until the tears come.<p>Granted, death is no laughing matter, but Southern funerals definitely can be, as Gayden Metcalfe and Charlotte Hays show. The irreverent pair hail from the Mississippi Delta, and even though I grew up in Tennessee I recognize every character in the book. (I have no way of knowing if the people mentioned are real or invented. I have never met Metcalfe, who still lives in Mississippi, but Hays is a Washington journalist whom I do know.) The subtitle -- "The Official Southern Ladies Guide to Hosting the Perfect Funeral" -- pretty well sums it up, yet there is no way to suggest the fun of this book without quoting just about every tongue-in-cheek sentence.</p><p> As an added bonus, each chapter concludes with wonderful, easy-to-follow Southern recipes, so you learn not only how to give a flawless funeral, but also how to prepare the foods that are necessary to this quintessential Southern experience.</p><p>"After the solemnity of the church service and finality of the grave, the people of the Mississippi Delta are just dying to get to the house of the bereaved for the reception. . . . Friends and family begin arriving with covered dishes, finger foods, and sweets as soon as the word is out that somebody has died."</p><p> Certain foods are essential for burying a self-respecting Deltan. "Chief among these is tomato aspic with homemade mayonnaise -- without which you practically can't get a death certificate." Others in the Top 10 list of funeral foods are fried chicken, stuffed eggs, Virginia's Butter Beans, Can't-Die-Without-It Caramel Cake, homemade rolls, banana nut bread, Aunt Hebe's Coconut Cake, Methodist Party Potatoes and tenderloin.</p><p>Where you are buried is also very important. "The old cemetery is one of the best addresses in Greenville. . . . Being buried anywhere else is a fate worse than death." Cremation is still a "new and dicey" proposition in the Delta. "The last time somebody was cremated, his ashes were sprinkled from a crop duster. We all ran for cover. We liked him fine, but we didn't want him all over our good clothes."</p><p>Appearance is important, too. Even in death, Southern women always want to look their best, and it was said that Bubba Boone, the local undertaker, could do a better job than any plastic surgeon. </p><p> The ladies' advice for those who want a tasteful send-off, with "great vestments" but no "tacky hymns" or "smells and bells," is to join St. James' Episcopal Church. "Southern Episcopalians wear their devoutness lightly. That's one reason they excel at funerals. . . . They are sensitive enough to know that simply being dead doesn't mean you no longer care about social status."</p><p>Nobody wants an ill-attended funeral, and St. James' turns out in full force for one of its own. However, for a really big funeral, membership in both St. James' and Alcoholics Anonymous is the ticket. "Episcopalians who have belonged to AA attract a standing-room-only crowd, without increasing the liquor bill for the reception." </p><p>There's a Protestant church caste system in almost every Southern town, and in Greenville, the authors say, the Episcopalians and Presbyterians generally thought themselves a cut above the Methodists, described by one lady as "frustrated Baptists who would like to be Episcopalians." "They'd like to whoop and holler," the authors comment, "but they are not deaf to the clarion call of social mobility." (Full disclosure: I was raised a Methodist, and in my hometown, evangelicals, now so courted in Washington, were beyond the pale.)</p><p>Metcalfe and Hays report that while there is no theological animosity between Episcopalians and Methodists, the culinary rivalry is cutthroat: "Episcopalians are snooty because they spurn cake mixes and canned goods, without which there would be no such thing as Methodist cuisine." But everybody has to look down on somebody, they observe, so for Methodists, there are the Baptists, who put "little bitty marshmallows" on their congealed salads.</p><p>The writers tackle all the key issues. If you die a Methodist, they ask, can the mourners enjoy the full range of consolations? Maybe not. "If you feel your family will be so devastated by your departure that they'll require the solace of strong drink," they advise, "join St. James'. Immediately."</p><p>The ladies insist that people do not "pass away." They die. One still writes condolence letters by hand. Paper napkins at the reception are verboten. As for music, "It is never a good idea to choose a hymn with a lot of high notes. . . . You can't go wrong with the old standards, like 'Oh, God, Our Help in Ages Past.' This will work well for almost anybody but the most out-and-out atheist." For obvious reasons, "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" is a no-no. They warn against "On Eagle's Wings," whose popularity " has spread like kudzu." As for flowers: positively no carnations or gladioli.</p><p> In a chapter titled, "I Was So Embarrassed I Liketa Died," the authors remind us that, unlike the dead person, you will awaken and rise in the morning. Hence one of their most valuable bits of advice: You can have fun at a funeral, and especially at the reception, but "you don't want to have been so bad you wish you could switch places with the deceased." </p><p>Reviewed by Selwa Roosevelt <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Her books are international bestsellers.The Shadow of Your Smile 1<p></p> <br><br> <br>On Monday morning, Olivia Morrow sat quietly across the desk from her longtime friend Clay Hadley, absorbing the death sentence he had just pronounced.<br> <br>For an instant, she looked away from the compassion she saw in his eyes and glanced out the window of his twenty-fourth-floor office on East Seventy-second Street in Manhattan. In the distance she could see a helicopter making its slow journey over the East River on this chilly October morning.<br> <br>My journey is ending, she thought, then realized that Clay was expecting a response from her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two weeks,&#x201d; she said. It was not a question. She glanced at the antique clock on the bookcase behind Clay&#x2019;s desk. It was ten minutes past nine. The first day of the two weeks&#x2014;at least it&#x2019;s the start of the day, she thought, glad that she had asked for an early appointment.<br> <br>He was answering her. &#x201c;Three at the most. I&#x2019;m sorry, Olivia. I was hoping . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be sorry,&#x201d; Olivia interrupted briskly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m eighty-two years old. Even though my generation lives so much longer than the previous ones, my friends have been dropping like flies lately. Our problem is that we worry we&#x2019;ll live too long and end up in a nursing home, or become a terrible burden to everyone. To know I have a very short time left, but will still be able to think clearly and walk around unassisted until the very end is an immeasurable gift.&#x201d; Her voice trailed off.<br> <br>Clay Hadley&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. He understood the troubled expression that had erased the serenity from Olivia&#x2019;s face. Before she spoke, he knew what she would say. &#x201c;Clay, only you and I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do we have the right to continue to hide the truth?&#x201d; she asked, looking at him intently. &#x201c;Mother thought she did. She intended to take it to her grave, but at the very end when only you and I were there, she felt compelled to tell us. It became for her a matter of conscience. And with all the enormous good Catherine did in her life as a nun, her reputation has always been compromised by the insinuation that all those years ago, just before she entered the convent, she may have had a consensual liaison with a lover.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hadley studied Olivia Morrow&#x2019;s face. Even the usual signs of age, the wrinkles around her eyes and mouth, the slight tremor of her neck, the way she leaned forward to catch everything he said, did not detract from her finely chiseled features. His father had been her mother&#x2019;s cardiologist, and he had taken over when his father retired. Now in his early fifties, he could not remember a time when the Morrow family had not been part of his life. As a child he had been in awe of Olivia, recognizing even then that she was always beautifully dressed. Later he realized that at that time she had still been working as a salesgirl at B. Altman&#x2019;s, the famous Fifth Avenue department store, and that her style was achieved by buying her clothes at giveaway end-of-the-season sales. Never married, she had retired as an executive and board member of Altman&#x2019;s years ago.<br> <br>He had met her older cousin Catherine only a few times, and by then she was already a legend, the nun who had started seven hospitals for handicapped children&#x2014;research hospitals dedicated to finding ways to cure or alleviate the suffering of their damaged bodies or minds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know that many people are calling the healing of a child with brain cancer a miracle and attributing it to Catherine&#x2019;s intercession?&#x201d; Olivia asked. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s being considered as a candidate for beatification.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clay Hadley felt his mouth go dry. &#x201c;No, I hadn&#x2019;t heard.&#x201d; Not a Catholic, he vaguely understood that that would mean the Church might eventually declare Sister Catherine a saint and worthy of veneration by the faithful.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course that will mean that the subject of her having given birth will be explored, and those vicious rumors will resurface and almost certainly finish her chance of being found worthy,&#x201d; Olivia added, her tone angry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Olivia, there was a reason neither Sister Catherine nor your mother ever named the father of her child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Catherine didn&#x2019;t. But my mother did.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivia leaned her hands on the arms of the chair, a signal to Clay that she was about to stand up. He rose and walked around his desk, with quick steps for such a bulky man. He knew that some of his patients referred to him as &#x201c;Chunky Clay the Cardiologist.&#x201d; His voice humorous, his eyes twinkling, he counseled all of them, &#x201c;Forget about me and make sure you lose weight. I look at the picture of an ice cream cone and put on five pounds. It&#x2019;s my cross to bear.&#x201d; It was a performance he had perfected. Now he took Olivia&#x2019;s hands in his and kissed her gently.<br> <br>Involuntarily she drew back from the sensation of his short, graying beard grazing her cheek, then to cover her reaction returned the kiss. &#x201c;Clay, my own situation remains between us. I will tell the few remaining people who will care very soon.&#x201d; She paused, then, her tone ironic, she added, &#x201c;In fact I&#x2019;d obviously better tell them very soon. Perhaps fortunately, I don&#x2019;t have a single family member left.&#x201d; Then she stopped, realizing that what she had just said wasn&#x2019;t true.<br> <br>On her deathbed her mother had told her that after Catherine realized she was pregnant, she had spent a year in Ireland, where she had given birth to a son. He had been adopted by the Farrells, an American couple from Boston who were selected by the Mother Superior of the religious order Catherine entered. They had named him Edward, and he had grown up in Boston.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve followed their lives ever since, Olivia thought. Edward didn&#x2019;t marry until he was forty-two. His wife has been dead a long time, and he passed away about five years ago. Their daughter, Monica, is thirty-one now, a pediatrician on the staff of Greenwich Village Hospital. Catherine was my first cousin. Her granddaughter is my cousin. She is my only family, and she doesn&#x2019;t know I exist.<br> <br>Now, as she withdrew her hands from Clay&#x2019;s grasp, she said, &#x201c;Monica has turned out to be so like her grandmother, devoting her life to taking care of babies and little children. Do you realize what all that money would mean to her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Olivia, don&#x2019;t you believe in redemption? Look at what the father of her child did with the rest of his life. Think of the lives he saved. And what about his brother&#x2019;s family? They&#x2019;re prominent philanthropists. Think what such disclosure will mean to them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am thinking about it, and that&#x2019;s what I have to weigh. Monica Farrell is the rightful heir to the income from those patents. Alexander Gannon was her grandfather, and in his will he left everything he had to his issue if any existed and only then to his brother. I&#x2019;ll call you, Clay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Clay Hadley waited until the door of his private office closed, then picked up the phone and dialed a number that was known to very few people. When a familiar voice answered he did not waste time in preliminaries. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s exactly what I was afraid of. I know Olivia . . . she&#x2019;s going to talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t let that happen,&#x201d; the person on the other end of the line said matter-of-factly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to make sure it doesn&#x2019;t. Why didn&#x2019;t you give her something? With her medical condition, no one would question her death.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Believe it or not, it isn&#x2019;t that simple to kill someone. And suppose she manages to leave the proof before I can stop her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In that case we take out double insurance. Sad to say, a fatal attack on an attractive young woman in Manhattan is hardly an extraordinary event these days. I&#x2019;ll take care of it immediately.&#x201d;</p><h2>Design by Nature: Creating Layered, Lived-in Spaces Inspired by the Natural World</h2><p><b><b>The first design book that translates elements of nature--including flora, water, and wood--into elements of decor for beautiful, lived-in, bohemian interiors, from acclaimed designer and tastemaker Erica Tanov. </b></b><br><br>Inspired by nature's colors, textures, and patterns, design icon Erica Tanov uses her passion for textiles to create beautiful, timeless interiors that connect us to the natural world.

I steer away from anything too perfect or manicured and prefer to create beautiful, relaxed spaces by embracing objects with their imperfections. I&#x2019;m basically&nbsp;a refined hippie&#x2014;attracted to the loose, natural, and raw and things in disrepair&#x2014;yet am also drawn to pieces with a hint of glamour and opulence. I believe in buying high-quality goods although the name of the maker or designer is not important. I buy lasting things that I love.&nbsp;<br><br>Everything I do, from designing clothing or wallpaper to arranging a room, aspires to reflect the effortless beauty of the natural world. My designs are often inspired by simple sights: the trees in my backyard, the fallen leaves and blooming flowers I see on my walks, or a single fern casting its shadow on my porch. I love the flawed beauty inherent in nature. Perfectly imperfect. I want everything I design and make to have that same relaxed sensibility.&nbsp;<br><br>My wish is for you to find inspiration in your own surroundings. It isn&#x2019;t about traveling far and wide to beautiful landscapes (although that never hurts), but, rather, it&#x2019;s about discovering beauty right outside your door. It can be something as grand as an old tree with wide-reaching limbs or something as small as a tiny leaf or acorn. You can find inspiration in a weed blowing gracefully on the freeway or the pattern of the craggy bark of an oak tree. You can be moved by the intense ochre colors of lichen growing on a branch or fallen twig&nbsp;or the damp fertile smell after a rain.

Now Michael&#x2019;s former partners are about to become his bitter enemies. Because to them, Michael Brock is the most dangerous man on the streets.</p><p>John Grisham is back with his latest courtroom conundrum, <i>The Street Lawyer</i>. This time the lord of legal thrillers dives deep into the world of the homeless, particularly their barely audible legal voice in a world dominated by large, all-powerful law firms. Our hero, Michael Brock, is on the fast track to partnership at D.C.'s premier law firm, Sweeny &amp; Drake. His dream of someday raking in a million-plus a year is finally within reach. Nothing can stop him, not even 90-hour workweeks and a failing marriage--until he meets DeVon Hardy, a.k.a. "Mister," a Vietnam vet with a grudge against his landlord--and a few lawyers to fry. Hardy, with no clear motive, takes Brock and eight of his colleagues hostage in a boardroom, demanding their tax returns and interrogating them with a conviction that would have put perpetrators of the Spanish Inquisition to shame. Hardy, a man of few words and a lot of ammunition, mumbles cryptically, "Who are the evictors?" as he points a .44 automatic within inches of Brock's face. The violent outcome of the hostage situation triggers an abrupt soul-searching for the young lawyer, and Hardy's mysterious question continues to haunt him. Brock learns that Hardy had been in and out of homeless shelters most of his life, but he had recently begun paying rent in a rundown building; that means he has legal recourse when a big money-making outfit such as Sweeny &amp; Drake boots him with no warning. When Brock realizes that his profession caters to the morally challenged, he sets out on an aimless search through the dicier side of D.C., ending up at the 14th Street Legal Clinic. The clinic's director, a gargantuan man named Mordecai Green, woos Brock to the clinic with a $90,000 cut in pay and the chance to redeem his soul. Brock takes it--and some of the story's credibility along with it; it's hard to believe that a Yale graduate who sacrificed everything--including his marriage--to succeed in the legal profession would quickly jump at the opportunity for low-paying, charitable work. However, Brock's search for corruption in the swanky upper echelons of Sweeny &amp; Drake (via the toughest streets of D.C.) is filled with colorful characters and realistic, gritty descriptions. In the <i>The Street Lawyer</i>, Grisham once again defends the voiceless and powerless. In the words of Mordecai Green, "That's justice, Michael. That's what street law is all about. Dignity."Michael was in a hurry. He was scrambling up the ladder at Drake &amp; Sweeney, a giant D.C. law firm with eight hundred lawyers. The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience.<br>But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who'd been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake &amp; Sweeney.<br>The fast track derailed; the ladder collapsed. Michael bolted the firm and took a top-secret file with him. He landed in the streets, an advocate for the homeless, a street lawyer.<br>And a thief.</p><h2>Bad Kitty for President (paperback black-and-white edition)</h2><p><p>The votes are in--it's a Bad Kitty landslide!</p><p>It's time to elect a new president of the Neighborhood Cat Coalition!

The high-contrast pictures and exclamatory text are guaranteed eye and ear magnets for the littlest ones." &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b><br><br>"I saw the baby!&nbsp;<br>Did you see the baby?"<br>"Yes! I saw the baby, the teeny weeny thing."<br><br>It's so exciting! News of the baby is buzzing from animal to animal, with each one &#x2014; fish, bird, squirrel, insect, frog &#x2014; boasting of seeing, feeding, singing to, tickling, and kissing the tiny little thing. With bold, graphic black-and-white illustrations, Mary Murphy's simple, singsong story captures the giddy commotion that only a baby can bring.</p><p>Mary Murphy is the author and illustrator of a number of children&#x2019;s books, including HOW KIND!. I KISSED THE BABY!, she says, "is about how excited everyone is to welcome a new baby into the community. It&#x2019;s best read, like a nursery rhyme, by whomever is holding Baby at the time." She lives in Galway, Ireland.PreS. This pithy story, illustrated primarily in black and white, catches the excitement of a new baby in the house. White, free-form animal characters set against pure black backgrounds share the news: a baby has arrived. "I saw the baby! Did you see the baby?" the fish asks. Well, yes. The chicken has fed the baby; the butterfly has sung to it; the ant even tickled it. When the mouse asks the duck if it has kissed the baby, the duck answers, "Of course . . . my own amazing baby." On the next two spreads she kisses the bright yellow duckling again, causing it to "Quack! Quack! Quack!" This is simplicity itself, and it is perhaps surprising that Murphy wrings so much emotion out of bare-bones graphic art. But she does, and her book crackles with love, exhilaration, and even sweetness. Everyone will want to kiss this baby--or their own. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The People fought hard, but eventually agreed to stop fighting and signed treaties.</p><p>Many things changed and became more difficult, but The People continued to farm and create crafts. They remembered and told their children, "You are Shawnee. You are Lakota. You are Pima. You Acoma. . . . You are all these Nations of the People."

Her artwork has been shown throughout the U.S. since 1977. Her Native American Indian lineage includes Chief Tecumseh of the Shawnee Tribe and Chief Peter Graves of the Red Lake Chippewa Tribe. She is a member of the Absentee Shawnee tribe.A compact and rightly sobering overview of the history of native Americans, this begins with their story of Creation and continues through the white man's usurpation of Indian lands and, too often, lore. It is written in straightforward syntax and in the cadences of traditional oral narration; as such, it derives its power from direct, forceful statements and the repetition of phrases and rhythms that assume a quiet insistence. The accompanying illustrations are similarly unembroidered yet dignified; they contain simply drawn figures and shapes, strong, vivid colors and a minimum of pattern and detail. A self-described "teaching story" whose mission is to instill a sense of responsibility for life, this is necessarily expository rather than dramatic; its lesson is inarguably worthy.

The Single Plane Golf Swing: Play Better Golf the Moe Norman Way reveals the secrets of the swing that enabled him to hit the ball solidly with unerring accuracy and consistency-every time. Norman&#39;s simple, efficient, and easily understood Single Plane Swing has improved the games of thousands of golfers. Golf professional Todd Graves, known as &#39;&#39;Little Moe&#39;&#39; and regarded as the world authority on Norman&#39;s swing, comprehensively teaches readers the mechanics, drills, and feelings of the Single Plane Swing that Moe called &#39;&#39;The Feeling of Greatness.&#39;&#39; Graves shares Norman&#39;s brilliant insights and liberating approach to the game and demonstrates why the conventional &#39;&#39;tour&#39;&#39; swing is too complex and frustrating for the majority of amateurs. Illustrated with more than 300 photographs and written with Tim O&#39;Connor, Norman&#39;s biographer, the book also engagingly tells Norman&#39;s bittersweet life story and explores the teacher-student bond forged between Norman and his protï¿½gï¿½ Graves.</p><p>Todd Graves is the world&#39;s best-known teacher of the Single Plane Swing, which was developed by Moe Norman, the greatest ball-striker in the history of golf according to many of golf&#39;s most respected names.

I see me'.'' --Barry Morrow, Oscar (Rain Man) and Emmy (Bill) award-winning writer<br><br>''One of golf's greatest untold stories, Moe Norman's life illustrated a simple and powerful truth: greatness is built from practicing the right swing in the right way.

Then a series of secrets leads the partners right into the frantic hunt that is confounding even the FBI.

For the closer they get to the truth, the closer they get to the most shocking surprise of all.</p><p>Two disgraced former Secret Service officers team up to solve a series of copy-cat crimes in this exciting new thriller by a master of the game. Sean King was momentarily distracted when a presidential candidate he'd been guarding was assassinated a few feet from where he stood, and Michelle Maxwell left the Service under a similar cloud when she lost a "protectee" to an ingenious kidnapping scheme, events told in Baldacci's typical terse, fast-paced style in <i>Split Second</i>. Now partners in a private investigation firm in a small Virginia town, they're hired to investigate a burglary at the home of a wealthy local family. But even before the chief suspect in the break-in meets his death in a gruesome slaying reminiscent of a serial killer long since caught and punished, King and Maxwell get caught up in a string of other murders, each of which copies the techniques of another madman, from San Francisco's Zodiac Killer to Chicago's infamous John Wayne Gacy. While the two protagonists aren't especially complex or well-developed, the action never stops, and Baldacci's trademark pacing keeps the reader turning pages until the denouement, which unfortunately isn't quite as satisfying as the rest of the novel. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p> </p><p></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> <b><i>Why Hour Game</i>: An Exclusive Essay by David Baldacci</b> <br></p><p> It's hard not to notice that the majority of fictional serial killers are cut from the same mold.

Saroo had become lost on a train in India at the age of five. Not knowing the name of his family or where he was from, he survived for weeks on the streets of Kolkata before being taken into an orphanage and adopted by a couple in Australia. Despite being happy in his new family, Saroo always wondered about his origins. When he was a young man the advent of Google Earth led him to pore over satellite images of India for landmarks he recognized. And one day, after years of searching, he miraculously found what he was looking for and set off on a journey to find his mother.<br><br>This edition features new material from Saroo about his childhood, including a new foreword and a Q&amp;A about his experiences and the process of making the film.<br><b>"The emotional journey of Saroo Brierley (Patel) . . . will melt hearts around the globe."&#x2014;<i>People</i> magazine<br><br>"Amazing stuff."&#x2014;<i>The New York Post</i></b></p><p><b>Saroo Brierley</b> (saroobrierley.com) was born in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, India.

It was her refuge from the deep wounds inflicted by a devastating war, her sanctuary where she knelt before a loving God and prayed for the children who couldn&#x2019;t understand her silent sacrifices.<br><br>Now, eighty-four-year-old Leota Reinhardt is alone, her beloved garden in ruins. All her efforts to reconcile with her adult children have been fruitless, and she voices her despair to a loving Father, her only friend.<br><br>Then God brings a wind of change through unlikely means: one, a college student with an agenda all his own who thinks he has all the answers; the other, a granddaughter Leota never hoped to know. But can the devastation wrought by keeping painful family secrets be repaired before she runs out of time?<br><br><b>&#x201c;Rivers is a master gardener . . . using poignant humor and bittersweet revelation to open hearts to reconciliation.&#x201d; <i>Romantic Times</i></b><br><br>Also available in <i>The Francine Rivers Contemporary Collection</i> (e-book only).</p><p>Acclaimed Christian fiction writer Francine Rivers's (<i>The Atonement Child</i>) <i>Leota's Garden</i> uses the image of the garden as a metaphor for the cycles of life that the characters experience. While the story revolves around a number of lives, they are all connected through Leota--an 84-year-old grandmother--and her garden, which was once a place of beauty and hope but has in recent years gone to ruin. Beginning in desolation--Leota has been neglected by her self-centered daughter, whose obsession with getting her own daughter into the best college has driven them apart--the novel slowly shows the weaving together of lives in the mysterious ways of grace: a proud and narrow-minded college student ends up learning more from Leota than he'd bargained for, and the granddaughter Leota had never been allowed to know shows up looking for some answers, and even more, looking for Leota herself. A garden blooms, the novel suggests, by getting one's hands a little dirty doing the hard work of love. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i><b>Francine Rivers</b> began her literary career at the University of Nevada, Reno, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and journalism.

It is for those men who battle daily for their souls and for their family. It is often a struggle to shed the sins and vices the world offers men, but it&#x2019;s a battle we must fight and win.<br><br> In Part I, Bishop Thomas Olmsted calls for Catholic men to step up and &#x201c;into the breach&#x201d; in service to God, their families, parishes, and wider communities. In the course of his exhortation, Olmsted unveils:&nbsp;<br><br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How being a Christian man is far more than physical prowess or worldly power<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why the world and the Church desperately need men&#x2014;real men&#x2014;to fight for them in spiritual combat<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The vital importance of prayer and the sacraments in the life of every man<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why fatherhood, fully understood, is so crucial for every man<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The value of devotion to a patron saint (complete with 10 manly suggestions)<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most importantly, how men have the perfect model of man in Jesus Christ, and how we can follow his example.<br><br> In Part II, Cook presents a treasure trove of prayers, church teachings, and writings from the saints that serve as a tremendous source of inspiration for men seeking to become better men of God. It is at once an essential guide and a profound book of prayers designed specifically for men.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, perhaps more than ever, men need to be men. But what it means to be a man has been twisted into a pale and mangled image of true manhood.&nbsp;Manual for Men&nbsp;serves as a field guide and instruction manual for those husbands, fathers, sons and brothers who would become real men of God&#x2014; men who protect, physically and spiritually, those entrusted to them; men who sacrifice, pray, fight, love, and live by the example of Christ.&nbsp;<br><br> There is a battle for our souls, our families, our world, and Our Lord calls us men to fight. Are you ready to answer the call? Will you accept Bishop Olmsted&#x2019;s plea to &#x201c;engage in the battle that is raging around you&#x201d;?</p><p>The Most Rev. Thomas J.

Before serving in Wichita, he served as the Rector / President of the Pontifical College Josephinum, a Catholic Seminary in Columbus, Ohio.<br><br> Since 1974, Bishop Olmsted has been a member of the&nbsp;Jesus Caritas&nbsp;ï¿½fraternity of priests, and thus has been deeply influenced by the witness and wisdom of Charles de Foucauld and by the prayers and encouragement of many brother priests.<br><br> For 16 years, Bishop Olmsted lived in Rome, Italy, where he obtained a master&#x2019;s degree in theology, a doctorate in Canon Law, and worked more than nine years in the Secretariat of State of the Holy See. During the nine years of serving in the Holy See, he resided at the Pontifical North American College and assisted seminarians with spiritual direction.<br><br> Having been reared on a family farm on the Kansas-Nebraska border, he attended a single-room grade school near Oketo, Kansas, and a small rural high school in Summerfield, Kansas.

The text explores how equitable collaboration entails ongoing processes that begin with families and communities, transform power, build reciprocity and agency, and foster collective capacity through collective inquiry. These processes offer promising possibilities for improving student learning, transforming educational systems, and developing robust partnerships that build on the resources, expertise, and cultural practices of nondominant families. Based on empirical research and inquiry-driven practice, this book describes core concepts and provides multiple examples of effective practices.</p> <p><strong>Book Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Broadens the dominant conception of leadership to include traditionally marginalized parents and communities as potential educational leaders.</li> <li>Explores partnerships from both a systemwide and in-school basis, with detailed portraits of what is possible.</li> <li>Translates theoretical principles at multiple scales: systemic, school, and individual practice.</li> <li>Shares studies focused on a broad range of contexts, strategies, and practices for enacting equitable collaboration with families.</li></ul></p><p><p><strong>Ann M.

Deep and complex theories and histories around race, power, and privilege in school and community are articulated in powerful and accessible ways, making this a must-read for educators and scholars alike.

He lives in New York City with his wife and son.Chapter 1<br><br>Notes from the First Year<br><br>-<br><br>This story began, as all writing must, in failure. It was February 2007. I was seated in a state office building on 125th Street, not far from the Jamaican patty joint, not far from the fried fish spot, both of which I put to so much injudicious use in those days of conspicuous failure. I was thirty-one years old. I was living in Harlem with my partner, Kenyatta, and our son, Samori, both named for African anti-colonialists, of consecutive centuries. The names reflected a household ostensibly committed to the dream of pan-Africa, to the notion that black people here and there are united with black people then and now in a grand operatic struggle. This idea was the deep subtext of our lives. It had to be. The visible text was survivalist.<br><br>I had just lost my third job in seven years and so I&#x2019;d come to that state office building for a brief seminar on work, responsibility, and the need to stay off the dole. &#x201c;The dole&#x201d; was small, time-limited, and humiliating to access. How anyone could enjoy or accustom themselves to it was beyond me. But the ghost of welfare reform past was strong and haunted the halls of unemployment offices everywhere. There in a classroom, amid a cohort of presumed losers and layabouts, I took my lessons in the great sin of idleness. The venue at least felt appropriate; the classroom had always been the site of my most indelible failures and losses. In the classrooms of my youth, I was forever a &#x201c;conduct&#x201d; problem, forever in need of &#x201c;improvement,&#x201d; forever failing to &#x201c;work up to potential.&#x201d; I wondered then if something was wrong with me, if there was some sort of brain damage that compelled me to color outside the lines. I&#x2019;d felt like a failure all of my life&#x2014;stumbling out of middle school, kicked out of high school, dropping out of college. I had learned to tread in this always troubled water. But now I felt myself drowning, and now I knew I would not drown alone.<br><br>Kenyatta and I had been together for nine years, and during that time I had never been able to consistently contribute a significant income. I was a writer and felt myself part of a tradition stretching back to a time when reading and writing were, for black people, the marks of rebellion. I believed, somewhat absurdly, that they still were. And so I derived great meaning from the work of writing. But I could not pay rent with &#x201c;great meaning.&#x201d; I could not buy groceries with &#x201c;great meaning.&#x201d; With &#x201c;great meaning&#x201d; I overdrew accounts. With &#x201c;great meaning&#x201d; I burned through credit cards and summoned the IRS. Wild and unlikely schemes often appeared before me. Maybe I should go to culinary school. Maybe I should be a bartender. I&#x2019;d considered driving a cab. Kenyatta had a more linear solution: &#x201c;I think you should spend more time writing.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, in that classroom, going through all the mandated motions, I could not see it. I could not see anything. And like almost every other lesson administered to me in a classroom, I don&#x2019;t remember a single thing said that day. And as with all the other buried traumas accumulated in the classrooms, I did not allow myself to feel the ache of that failure. Instead, I fell back on the old habits and logic of the street, where it was so often necessary to deny humiliation and transmute pain into rage. So I took the agony of that era like a collection notice and hid it away in the upper dresser of the mind, resolved to return to it when I had means to pay. I think now, today, I have settled almost all of those old accounts. But the ache and aftershock of failure remain long after the drawer is bare.<br><br>I can somehow remember all that I did not allow myself to feel walking away from the unemployment office and through the Harlem streets that day, just as I remember all that I did not let myself feel in those young years trapped between the schools and the street. And I know that there are black boys and black girls out there lost in a Bermuda triangle of the mind or stranded in the doldrums of America, some of them treading and some of them drowning, never feeling and never forgetting. The most precious thing I had then is the most precious thing I have now&#x2014;my own curiosity. That is the thing I knew, even in the classroom, they could not take from me. That is the thing that buoyed me and eventually plucked me from the sea.<br><br>Like any myth of self-generated success, there is some truth here. But the greater truth is that the wind around me awakened and shifted to blow my small vessel back to civilization. My curiosity had long been focused on the color line, a phenomenon that, in those mid-aughts, seemed in an odd flux. National energies had shifted in the wake of 9/11. The most crucial questions of justice during the Bush years revolved around spying and torture. The old civil rights generation was aging out, and there was a general fatigue, even among black activists, with the paratrooper model of leadership represented by Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. The choreography had gotten repetitive. Some outrage would be perpetrated. A march would be held. Predictable positions and platitudes exchanged. And the original offense would fade from memory. The outrage was, most often, crucial and very real&#x2014;the killing of Sean Bell by the NYPD, for instance. But the lack of any substantive action, and, more, the fact that the tactics seemed to not have changed in some forty years, made many of us feel that we were not witnessing movement politics so much as a kind of cathartic performance. Outside of the activist community, a different idea was ascendant, the notion that we needed to, somehow, &#x201c;get past&#x201d; the &#x201c;distraction&#x201d; of racism. There were books lamenting the deployment of the so-called race card and articles asserting the need to &#x201c;look beyond&#x201d; race in understanding the perils of the black community. No matter how sincere or disingenuous its expression, there was a palpable hunger for something new.<br><br>In the same season I found myself in that Harlem unemployment office recounting failures, Barack Obama launched his bid for the presidency.<br><br>I had never seen a black man like Barack Obama. He talked to white people in a new language&#x2014;as though he actually trusted them and believed in them. It was not my language. It was not even a language I was much interested in, save to understand how he had come to speak it and its effect on those who heard it. More interesting to me was that he had somehow balanced that language with the language of the South Side. He referred to himself, unambiguously, as a black man. He had married a black woman. It is easy to forget how shocking this was, given the common belief at the time that there was a direct relationship between success and assimilation. The narrative held that successful black men took white wives and crossed over into that arid no-man&#x2019;s land that was not black, though it could never be white. Blackness for such men was not a thing to root yourself in but something to evade and escape. Barack Obama found a third way&#x2014;a means of communicating his affection for white America without fawning over it. White people were enchanted by him&#x2014;and those who worked in newsrooms seemed most enchanted of all. This fact changed my life. It was the wind shifting, without which my curiosity would&#x2019;ve stayed my own. <br><br>My contention is that Barack Obama is directly responsible for the rise of a crop of black writers and journalists who achieved prominence during his two terms. These writers were talented&#x2014;but talent is nothing without a field on which to display its gifts. Obama&#x2019;s presence opened a new field for writers, and what began as curiosity about the man himself eventually expanded into curiosity about the community he had so consciously made his home and all the old, fitfully slumbering questions he&#x2019;d awakened about American identity. I was one of those writers. And though I could not see it then, making that doleful trek home from the unemployment office, back from the classroom, back across 125th Street, the wind was waking all around me.<br><br>I had, in my last job, taken an interest in Bill Cosby, who also, it seemed, felt the call for something new. He was then touring the country&#x2019;s inner cities, intent on convincing his people to stop &#x201c;blaming the white man.&#x201d; The barnstorming began seemingly on impulse, initiated by the response to Cosby&#x2019;s infamous Pound Cake speech. In 2004, Cosby rose to the podium to speak, ostensibly to mark the fiftieth-anniversary commemoration of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision that ended school segregation, at an event sponsored by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The NAACP LDF made its name by appealing to the courts to hold the country accountable for the myriad ways Jim Crow plundered black life. But when Cosby took the stage, he was set on holding not the plunderer but the plundered accountable. He inveighed against &#x201c;the lower-economic and lower-middle-economic people&#x201d; for not holding up their end of the civil rights bargain. He attacked black youth for obsessing over &#x201c;$500 sneakers.&#x201d; He mocked black parents for giving their children names like &#x201c;Shaniqua and Mohammed.&#x201d; He fumed at black women for loose morality.<br><br>I objected to this characterization and wrote about it in The Village Voice&#x2014;another job I&#x2019;d lose&#x2014;shortly after he made the speech. But as it happened, some portion of &#x201c;the lower-economic and lower-middle-economic people&#x201d; actually agreed with Cosby. I know this because I saw Cosby take the message to them directly. He dubbed these sessions &#x201c;call-outs.&#x201d; Typically, Cosby would assemble local officials&#x2014;school principals, judges, parole officers, heads of community colleges&#x2014;and put them onstage. He&#x2019;d invite various &#x201c;at-risk youth&#x201d; to the event. The officials would then do their own version of the Pound Cake speech. The audience would cheer wildly. The spirit was one part Uncle Ruckus and one part Les Brown. It was flagellation. It was revival. But most of all it was nostalgia&#x2014;a hunger for the uncomplicated time when all black men worked hard, all black women were virtuous, and all black parents, collectively, whipped each other&#x2019;s kids. I know now that all people hunger for a noble, unsullied past, that as sure as the black nationalist dreams of a sublime Africa before the white man&#x2019;s corruption, so did Thomas Jefferson dream of an idyllic Britain before the Normans, so do all of us dream of some other time when things were so simple. I know now that that hunger is a retreat from the knotty present into myth and that what ultimately awaits those who retreat into fairy tales, who seek refuge in the mad pursuit to be made great again, in the image of a greatness that never was, is tragedy.<br><br>Cosby&#x2019;s call-outs also engendered much cheering from white pundits. This was not surprising or interesting&#x2014;the call-outs made no demands on the white conscience, so there was nothing shocking about white people cheering him on. But the hunger for a noble past, the current of black nostalgia, fascinated me because the black past was, to my mind, not even a useful mine for nostalgia; it was segregation and slavery. And my fascination extended to Cosby himself. He was not a conservative in our binary sense of electoral politics. If Cosby was mostly conflated with the affable &#x201c;Dr. Huxtable&#x201d; he played on The Cosby Show, the bourgeois faï¿½ade of his most famous role obscured Cosby&#x2019;s sense of himself as a race man. He had supported the anti-apartheid struggle, donated to HBCUs, backed black leaders like Jesse Jackson and organizations like TransAfrica. He seemed to be reviving a race-based black conservatism that had no real home in America&#x2019;s left-right politics but deep roots in the black community.<br><br>I thought I had a story to tell about all of this&#x2014;a big one. I saw Cosby as emblematic of a strain of black thought that I disagreed with but wanted to understand. I wanted to draw this out with a mix of portraiture, opinion, and memoir. The essay that came from that&#x2014;&#x201c;This Is How We Lost to the White Man&#x201d;&#x2014;is an attempt to achieve that mix, if an ultimately unsuccessful one. But the attention it garnered and the relationship it began with The Atlantic marked the first period in my life where I was stable enough to make more attempts and thus fulfill my own dream of walking the same path as my heroes, of Baldwin, or Hurston. And like them, I sought with &#x201c;This Is How We Lost&#x201d; to find my own way to imagine black people as more than cartoons, as more than photo negatives or shadows.<br><br>The tradition of black writing is necessarily dyspeptic, necessarily resistant. That tradition was the house in which I wanted to live, and if my residency must be fixed to a certain point in time, I suppose fixing it here, with the publication of this piece, is as good as anywhere. I characterize this as an &#x201c;attempt&#x201d; because I felt myself trying to write a feeling, something dreamlike and intangible that lived in my head, and in my head is where at least half of it remained. And there were other challenges, more tangible, that were not met.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know if Cosby&#x2019;s call-outs were a cover for the torrent of rape allegations that swirled around him even then. I knew about the allegations. They&#x2019;d been written about by other journalists. I also know they deserved more than the one line they ultimately occupied in this piece. I had never actually written a story like &#x201c;This Is How We Lost to the White Man.&#x201d; I had never written for such a prestigious national publication. I had my own fears of failure lingering. Better to tell a neater story, I reasoned, than attempt the messier one and have to contend with editors I did not then know. But the messier one was truer&#x2014;indeed, the messier one might well have lent explanatory power to the simple story I chose to tell. And so it happened that in an attempt to analyze, in Cosby&#x2019;s movement, the lure of the simplistic, I myself fell prey to it.<br><br>And there was more to be said than even this that I did not say. There always is when you report and research, when you sit down to write and try to fit all the manifold sentiments you see, hear, and feel into some coherent arrangement of words. That was always the challenge in these years writing for The Atlantic, years that took me, ultimately, out of the unemployment office and into the Oval Office to bear witness to history. For all of that, in every piece in this book there is a story I told and many more I left untold, for better and worse. In the case of Bill Cosby, especially, it was for worse. That was my shame. That was my failure. And that was how this story began.</p><h2>The Turtle of Oman</h2><p><p>Praised by the <em>Horn Book</em> as &#x201c;both quiet and exhilarating,&#x201d; this novel by the acclaimed poet and National Book Award Finalist Naomi Shihab Nye follows Aref Al-Amri as he says goodbye to everything and everyone he loves in his hometown of Muscat, Oman, as his family prepares to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan.

His details of a Saigon Headquarters debriefing by Chief SOG, Colonel Steve Cavanaugh, are the first, in-depth recorded recollections of one of those taut, sometimes combative, sessions between the desk jockeys and the men whom they sent, all-too-often, to their deaths. His narration of the events which a History Channel program labeled &#x201c;Jungle Ambush,&#x201d; which is part of series titled &#x201c;Heroes Under Fire&#x201d;, will immediately immerse the reader in what it meant to &#x201c;win&#x201d; The Lottery at FOB 1. The Target Area encompassing the crossroads of Routes 92 and 922, best known by the one name that to this day will conjure images of death and destruction to any recon man who ever ran there: Oscar Eight; was the &#x201c;prize.&#x201d; That aspect of the book is sufficient to make the reader become glued to the pages, as the recon team faces what will eventually be revealed to be very, very long odds. The book is not simply about running and gunning, but also contains some intimate insight into the mind-set, the motivations, of these young men thrust into situations which few readers will ever come to understand. The fact that Black clearly states his initial motivation to return to Vietnam for a second tour does not mean that it truly reveals what will eventually be recognized by some readers as the great &#x201c;game&#x201d; &#x2013; the subconscious need to feel the rush of these missions. In what can only be called an existentialist bar scene, the &#x201c;liar&#x2019;s dice&#x201d; played by the veterans of cross-border missions is a reflection of the &#x201c;game&#x201d; played for real by the teams on the ground in Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam and in the DMZ. A careful reading of that chapter reveals much about the unwritten code of survival that was passed from veteran recon man to the new guys and will certainly draw the inevitable comparison to Remarque&#x2019;s All Quiet on the Western Front. Black also keeps the reader interested in his narrative by the generous use of some greatly humorous stories of the relationships between the men of recon company, their &#x201c;little people&#x201d; and with his adventures in the rear. Although in some instances (see the Chapter dealing with &#x201c;Sean Flynn&#x201d;) he leaves his readers wanting more answers (whatever happened to Bucky?) to some interesting side trips on which he leads us, it is fair to say that regardless of the destination, it will be memorable. Despite this very small criticism (&#x201c;I gots to know&#x201d; - to quote from Dirty Harry) my unquestionably favorite Black Op involves his experimentation with an unorthodox method to successfully capture a North Vietnamese Army POW.

But when a blue bunny and a yellow bird with some hidden differences of their own arrive, it's up to Neither to decide if they are welcome in the Land of All.<br><br> This colorful, simple, and touching story promotes diversity and offers a valuable lesson to the youngest of audiences: it is our differences that unite us.<br></p><p><b>Airlie Anderson</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>Cat's Colors</i>, <i>Momo and Snap Are Not Friends</i>, and numerous other books for children.

When a green bird-bunny hybrid is hatched, it declares itself Both. In the Land of This and That one must be one or the other, being both is not acceptable. So Both is instead declared Neither and it is suggested in no uncertain terms that as "not one of us" it should find "Somewhere Else." Both flies away and alights in the The Land of All where myriad creatures in all colors, shapes, and sizes live and all are welcome. Both even welcomes some of his former Landmates who don't fit in the Land of This and That. Featuring lots of bright bold colors, plenty of word balloons, and a ton of fantastic critters (like a purple butterfly cat) Anderson's illustrations are a perfect match for the message of her text. Who knew a bird-bunny face could be so expressive? Cleverly, Anderson never specifies a name or gender, so her bird-bunny is a perfect avatar for all.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for The New York Times and The Herald Tribune. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the Caldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low.</p><h2>The Collected Short Stories of Louis L&#39;Amour, Volume 2: Frontier Stories</h2><p>In paperback for the first time, this second volume of Louis L&#x2019;Amour&#x2019;s collected stories showcases thirty more classic tales of the American frontier.

This hook-nosed, greasy-haired, grumpy character is one of J.K. Rowling&#x2019;s enduring gifts to English literature. He&#x2019;s the archetypal ill-tempered teacher: acerbic, yet horribly, deliciously funny. When he&#x2019;s in a scene, you can&#x2019;t take your eyes off him. Snape is always the story. - From the Introduction <br> In this examination of J.K. Rowling's most enigmatic character, Lorrie Kim shows us how to sort through the illusions and lies to the man who dared to spy on Voldemort and without whom, Harry's story would have turned out very differently. In his final moments, he asks Harry (and the reader) to "Look at me."

But that&#x2019;s before they learn how the wooded park along the James River once held Union soldiers in a terrible prisoner-of-war camp. Legend says that the haunting lights over the rapids at night are the ghosts of long-dead soldiers still fighting the Civil War. The discovery of a haunting mural in the island&#x2019;s crumbling ruins leads the boys and their friend Caitlin into danger. To find the truth, they must brave menacing bullies and an encounter with a Confederate biker gang led by the notorious Mad Dog DeWitt. But some ghosts may be more alive than they ever expected. Join the kids as they face their fears across suspended bridges, secret hideouts, and graveyard ceremonies, while discovering names and places from the our country&#x2019;s tumultuous past like Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, Hollywood Cemetery, and Tredegar Iron Works. <i>Ghosts of Belle Isle</i> is the third book in <i>The Virginia Mysteries</i> series, but it can easily be read as a standalone.

He&#x2019;s herding the neighborhood kids!!Herding breed dogs such as Border Collies, Corgis, and Australian Shepherds have incredibly strong instinctive behaviors to do the work they were bred for&#x2014;controlling various kinds of livestock. <br><br>These behaviors manifest themselves in modern herding breed dogs kept as companions or family pets in a number of ways. These include chasing cars and bicyclists, herding kids, nipping at vulnerable heels, barking incessantly, and acting as the &#x201c;fun police&#x201d; in dog parks. All behaviors that are entirely appropriate and necessary when dealing with sheep or cattle, not so great in a suburban neighborhood. <br><br>Fortunately, these instincts can be redirected in a number of ways that keep these energetic dogs busy and happy as well as out of trouble. That is why so many of these dogs can be taught to excel in agility and obedience trials, love to retrieve, and make great running companions.

His own.<br>This edge-of-your-seat thriller will leave you breathless.</p><p>Caroline B. Cooney is the bestselling and award-winning author of numerous books for young people. She lives in Westbrook, Connecticut, and New York City.Chapter OneOn Friday, Mr. Lynch walked around the classroom making sure everybody had written down the due date in their assignment books. Luckily, he started at the far side, giving Mitty Blake time to whisper to his best friend, &#34;Due date for what?&#34;&#34;Notes for the term paper,&#34; whispered Derek. &#34;The one you&#39;ve been working on for four weeks?&#34;Mitty hadn&#39;t even chosen a topic yet.But Mr. Lynch had been teaching for years. He had encountered many Mittys. So although the paper itself didn&#39;t have to be turned in until February 18, on this coming Monday, February 2, each student in advanced biology had to submit an outline, ten pages of notes and a bibliography including four physical books.&#34;Books?&#34; said Mitty, stunned. He was sure this had not been mentioned before. &#34;Mr. Lynch, nobody uses books anymore. They&#39;re useless, especially in science. Facts change too fast.&#34;&#34;Books,&#34; repeated Mr. Lynch. &#34;This is to prevent you people from doing a hundred percent of your research online.&#34;Mitty had done zero percent anywhere, but he had certainly planned--insofar as Mitty had plans, which he didn&#39;t--to do his research online. So he said, &#34;Mr. Lynch, an actual book is out of date before it gets printed. Anyway, a good scientist does laboratory research.&#34;&#34;We did laboratory research last fall, Mitty,&#34; said Mr. Lynch. &#34;I don&#39;t recall that you threw yourself into your project. I recall that you received a passing grade only through the efforts of the rest of your team. A scientist, Mitty, has to be able to dig through the published research of others. A scientist has to grasp the background and history of things. That means books.&#34;Mitty was willing to grasp the background and history of rock music. On a slow day, he could listen to Nirvana or Pearl Jam. But the background and history of disease?Because that was the depressing topic of this assignment: infectious disease.&#34;Each of you,&#34; Mr. Lynch had said, so many weeks ago that Mitty could barely remember it, &#34;will choose an infectious disease of plants, animals or humans. You will study the disease in history and its ancient treatments or lack of them. If the disease has a specific history for us here in New York City--for example, during the yellow fever epidemics of the 1700s, people sometimes died at the rate of three hundred per city block per day--you will cover that. Other sections of your paper: description and course of the disease, current treatments and ongoing research. Finally, if your disease has an application in bioterrorism, you will cover that also.&#34;Even Mitty had awakened briefly to the exciting possibility of bioterrorism.Derek of course had wanted to be an exception to the rules. &#34;Can we research bioterrorism only? I want to do anthrax but specifically Ottilie Lundgren, the ninety-four-year-old woman who died of anthrax in 2001 when she opened her mail. She&#39;s FBI case number 184. It&#39;s impossible for me to use books. No book has been written about her yet. All my research has to be online.&#34; Derek warmed to a favorite topic. &#34;I can solve her mystery. I believe everything is online now, every clue I need, and I can nail her murderer.&#34;&#34;I would be proud of you,&#34; Mr. Lynch had said, without sarcasm, &#34;and you may focus on Ottilie Lundgren, but all that will do is make your paper longer. You still have to include everything I described and you still must have four books. Remember, class, that I too know how to use Amazon.com. I too can pull up a title that looks useful and stick it in a bibliography without actually reading the book. I too can open up the free first chapter and find something to put in my notes. I will know if you actually read a book or if you are cheating.&#34;Mr. Lynch was one of the few teachers who admitted that even here at St. Raphael&#39;s, a Manhattan prep school for the rich and/or brilliant (Mitty fell into the first category), there was such a thing as cheating. Other teachers skirted this possibility as if it were anthrax-laced mail.Right away, rare cool African diseases like Ebola and Lassa fever had been chosen by eager students. Two other kids also wanted anthrax but promised not to invade Derek&#39;s territory by mentioning Ottilie Lundgren. As the days went by, people began discussing their topics with excitement, as if they were genuinely interested. One girl had been allowed to choose Immunization: does it or does it not cause autism? Mitty would get autism just thinking about that. Another girl really did pick a plant disease and was deep into corn blight. Olivia, whom Mitty adored, had chosen typhoid fever and was already so advanced in her research that she was using the library of Columbia University&#39;s medical school, because every other library in New York City was too limited. Mitty hadn&#39;t been inside any library in the city of New York.As soon as Mr. Lynch finished ranting, Mitty slumped down in his seat. He had perfected the technique of listening to music on his iPod while a teacher talked. It was easy if he wore long sleeves. He kept the iPod in its armband and ran the cord down his arm and into his hand. Cupping the earpiece in his palm, he would rest his head on the same hand and listen to his music. His eyes stayed fixed on his teachers, who tended to be fond of him because he seemed so interested.Mitty&#39;s main interest was music. His life plan was to become a rock concert reviewer, the world&#39;s best job, and to prepare for this career, he had to buy, listen to and memorize everything out there. He really didn&#39;t have time for term papers. He certainly didn&#39;t have time for books.Mr. Lynch extended his hand for Mitty&#39;s assignment calendar.Every fall, St. Raphael&#39;s handed these out.</p><h2>Bus Station Mystery (18) (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>A puzzle in relationships concerns two boys ejected from the bus station.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car.

Then tragedy strikes--and Lou and her younger brother, Oz, must go with their invalid mother to live on their great-grandmother's farm in the Virginia mountains.<br><br>Suddenly Lou finds herself growing up in a new landscape, making her first true friend, and experiencing adventures tragic, comic, and audacious. When a dark, destructive force encroaches on her new home, her struggle will play out in a crowded Virginia courtroom...and determine the future of two children, an entire town, and the mountains they love.<br><b></b></p><p>David Baldacci has made a name for himself crafting big, burly legal thrillers with larger-than-life plots. However, <i>Wish You Well</i>, set in his native Virginia, is a tale of hope and wonder and "something of a miracle" just itching to happen. This shift from contentious urbanites to homespun hill families may come as a surprise to some of Baldacci's fans--but they can rest assured: the author's sense of pacing and exuberant prose have made the leap as well.<p> The year is 1940. After a car accident kills 12-year-old Lou's and 7-year-old Oz's father and leaves their mother Amanda in a catatonic trance, the children find themselves sent from New York City to their great-grandmother Louisa's farm in Virginia. Louisa's hardscrabble existence comes as a profound shock to precocious Lou and her shy brother. Still struggling to absorb their abandonment, they enter gamely into a life that tests them at every turn--and offers unimaginable rewards. For Lou, who dreams of following in her father's literary footsteps, the misty, craggy Appalachians and the equally rugged individuals who make the mountains their home quickly become invested with an almost mythic significance: </p><blockquote> They took metal cups from nails on the wall and dipped them in the water, and then sat outside and drank. Louisa picked up the green leaves of a mountain spurge growing next to the springhouse, which revealed beautiful purple blossoms completely hidden underneath. "One of God's little secrets," she explained.

If that plot is a trifle transparent--no one will be surprised by Amanda's miraculous recovery or by the children's eventual battle with the nefarious forces of industry in an attempt to save their great-grandmother's farm--neither reader nor character is the worse for it.

Cronin is a remarkable storyteller (just ask adoring fans of his award-winning <em>Mary and O'Neil</em>), whose gorgeous writing brings depth and vitality to this ambitious epic about a virus that nearly destroys the world, and a six-year-old girl who holds the key to bringing it back. <em>The Passage</em> takes readers on a journey from the early days of the virus to the aftermath of the destruction, where packs of hungry infected scour the razed, charred cities looking for food, and the survivors eke out a bleak, brutal existence shadowed by fear. Cronin doesn't shy away from identifying his "virals" as vampires. But, these are not sexy, angsty vampires (you won&#x2019;t be seeing "Team Babcock" t-shirts any time soon), and they are not old-school, evil Nosferatus, either. These are a creation all Cronin's own--hairless, insectile, glow-in-the-dark mutations who are inextricably linked to their makers and the one girl who could destroy them all. A huge departure from Cronin's first two novels, <em>The Passage</em> is a grand mashup of literary and supernatural, a stunning beginning to a trilogy that is sure to dazzle readers of both genres. --<em>Daphne Durham</em></p> <strong>Dan Chaon Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong> <p><b>Dan Chaon is the acclaimed author of the national bestseller <em>Await Your Reply</em> and <em>You Remind Me of Me</em>, which was named one of the best books of the year by <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em>, and <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, among other publications. Chaon lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and teaches at Oberlin College. Read his review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>There is a particular kind of reading experience--the feeling you get when you can&#x2019;t wait to find out what happens next, you can&#x2019;t turn the pages fast enough, and yet at the same time you are so engaged in the world of the story and the characters, you don&#x2019;t want it to end. It&#x2019;s a rare and complex feeling--that plot urgency pulling you forward, that yearning for more holding you back. We say that we are swept up, that we are taken away. Perhaps this effect is one of the true magic tricks that literature can offer to us, and yet it doesn&#x2019;t happen very often. Mostly, I think, we remember this experience from a few of the beloved books of our childhood.</p> <p>About three-quarters of the way through <em>The Passage</em>, I found myself in the grip of that peculiar and intense readerly emotion. One part of my brain couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to the next big revelation, and I found myself wanting to leapfrog from paragraph to paragraph, hurtling toward each looming climax. Meanwhile, another part of my brain was watching the dwindling final pages with dread, knowing that things would be over soon, and wishing to linger with each sentence and character a little while longer.</p> <p>Finishing <em>The Passage</em> for the first time, I didn&#x2019;t bother to put it on a shelf, because I knew I would be flipping back through its pages again the next day. Rereading. Considering. </p> <p>Certain kinds of books draw us into the lives of their characters, into their inner thoughts, to the extent that we seem to know them, as well as we know real people. Readers of Justin Cronin&#x2019;s earlier books, <em>Mary and O&#x2019;Neil</em> and <em>The Summer Guest</em>, will recognize him as an extraordinarily insightful chronicler of the ways in which people maneuver through the past, and through loss, grief and love. Though <em>The Passage</em> is a different sort of book, Cronin hasn&#x2019;t lost his skill for creating deeply moving character portraits. Throughout, in moments both large and small, readers will find the kind of complicated and heartfelt relationships that Cronin has made his specialty. Though the cast of characters is large, they are never mere pawns. The individual lives are brought to us with a vivid tenderness, and at the center of the story is not only vampires and gun battles but also quite simply a quiet meditation on the love of a man for his adopted daughter. As a fan of Cronin&#x2019;s earlier work, I found it exciting to see him developing these thoughtful character studies in an entirely different context.</p> <p>There are also certain kinds of books expand outwards beyond the borders of their covers. They make us wish for encyclopedias and maps, genealogies and indexes, appendixes that detail the adventures of the minor characters we loved but only briefly glimpsed. <em>The Passage</em> is that kind of book, too. There is a dense web of mythology and mystery that roots itself into your brain--even as you are turning the pages as quickly as you can. Complex secrets and untold stories peer out from the edges of the plot in a way that fires the imagination, so that the world of the novel seems to extend outwards, a whole universe--parts of which we glimpse in great detail--and yet we long to know even more. I hope it won&#x2019;t be saying too much to say that there are actually two universes in this novel, one overlapping the other: there is the world before the virus, and the world after, and one of the pleasures of the book is the way that those two worlds play off one another, each one twisting off into a garden of forking and intertwined paths. I think, for example, of the scientist Jonas Lear, and his journey to a fabled site in the jungles of Bolivia where clouds of bats descend upon his team of researchers; or the little girl, Amy, whose trip to the zoo sets the animals into a frenzy--"They know what I am," she says; or one of the men in Dr. Lear&#x2019;s experiment, Subject Zero, monitored in his cell as he hangs "like some kind of giant insect in the shadows." These characters and images weave their way through the story in different forms, recurring like icons, and there are threads to be connected, and threads we cannot quite connect--yet. And I hope that there will be some questions that will not be solved at all, that will just exist, as the universe of <em>The Passage</em> takes on a strange, uncanny life of its own. </p> <p>It takes two different kinds of books to work a reader up into that hypnotic, swept away feeling. The author needs to create both a deep intimacy with the characters, and an expansive, strange-but-familiar universe that we can be immersed in. <em>The Passage</em> is one of those rare books that has both these elements. I envy those readers who are about to experience it for the first time. </p> <p><strong>Danielle Trussoni Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong></p> <p><b>Danielle Trussoni is the author of <em>Falling Through the Earth: A Memoir</em>, which was the recipient of the 2006 Michener-Copernicus Society of America Award, a BookSense pick, and one of <em>The New York Times</em> Ten Best Books of 2006. Her first novel <em>Angelology</em> will be published in 30 countries. Read her review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Justin Cronin&#x2019;s <em>The Passage</em> is a dark morality tale of just how frightening things can become when humanity transgresses the laws of nature.</p> <p>The author of two previous novels, Cronin, in his third book, imagines the catastrophic possibilities of a vampiric bat virus unleashed upon the world. Discovered by the U.S. Military in South America, the virus is transported to a laboratory in the Colorado mountains where it is engineered to create a more invincible soldier. The virus&#x2019; potential benefits are profound: it has the power to make human beings immortal and indestructible. Yet, like Prometheus&#x2019; theft of fire from the Gods, knowledge and technological advancement are gained at great price: After the introduction of the virus into the human blood pool, it becomes clear that there will be hell to pay. The guinea pigs of the NOAH experiment, twelve men condemned to die on death row, become a superhuman race of vampire-like creatures called Virals. Soon, the population of the earth is either dead or infected, their minds controlled telepathically by the Virals. As most of human civilization has been wiped out by the Virals, the few surviving humans create settlements and live off the land with a fortitude the pilgrims would have admired. Only Amy, an abandoned little girl who becomes a mystical antidote to the creatures&#x2019; powers, will be able to save the world.</p> <p><em>The Passage</em> is no quick read, but a sweeping dystopian epic that will utterly transport one to another world, a place both haunting and horrifying to contemplate. Cronin weaves together multiple story lines that build into a journey spanning one hundred years and nearly 800 pages. While vampire lore lurks in the background--the Virals nick necks in order to infect humans, are immortal and virtually indestructible, and do most of their hunting at night--Cronin is more interested in creating an apocalyptic vision along the lines of Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s <em>The Road</em>.</p> <p>Taking place in a futuristic America where New Orleans is a military zone, Jenna Bush is the Governor of Texas and citizens are under surveillance, <em>The Passage</em> offers a gruesome and twisted version of reality, a terrifying dream world in which our very worst nightmares come true. Ultimately, like the best fiction, <em>The Passage</em> explores what it means to be human in the face of overwhelming adversity. The thrill comes with the knowledge that Amy and the Virals must face off in a grand battle for the fate of humanity.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Justin Cronin</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> What is <em>The Passage</em>?<br> <b>A:</b> A passage is, of course, a journey, and the novel is made up of journeys. But the notion of a journey in the novel, and indeed in the whole trilogy, is also metaphoric. A passage is a transition from one state or condition to another. The world itself makes such a transition in the book. So do all the characters&#x2014;as characters in a novel must. The title is also a reference to the soul&#x2019;s passage from life to death, and whatever lies in that unknown realm. Time and time again I&#x2019;ve heard it, and in my own life, witnessed it: people at the end of life want to go home. It is a literal longing, I think, to leave this world while in a place of meaning, among familiar things and faces. But it is also a celestial longing.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You are a PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author of literary fiction. Does <em>The Passage</em> represent a departure for you?<br> <b>A:</b> I think it&#x2019;d be a little silly of me not to acknowledge that <em>The Passage</em> is, in a number of ways, overtly different from my other books. But rather than calling it a &#x2018;departure,&#x2019; I&#x2019;d prefer to describe it as a progression or evolution. First of all, the themes that engage me as a person and a writer are all still present. Love, sacrifice, friendship, loyalty, courage. The bonds between people, parents and children especially. The pull of history, and the power of place, of landscape, to shape experience. And I don&#x2019;t think the writing itself is different at all. How could it be? You write how you write.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <em>The Passage</em> takes place all across America--from Philadelphia to Houston to southern California. What prompted you to choose these specific locations?<br> <b>A:</b> Many of the major locations in the novel are, in fact, places I have lived. Except for a long stint in Philadelphia, and now Houston, my life has been a bit nomadic. I was raised in the Northeast, but after college, I ping-ponged all over the country for a while. In some ways, shaking off my strictly Northeastern point of view has been the central project of my adult life. This gave me not only a sense of the sheer immensity of the continent, but also the great diversity of its textures, both geographical and cultural, and I wanted the book to capture this feeling of vastness, especially when the narrative jumps forward a hundred years and the continent has become depopulated. One of the most striking impressions of my travels across the country is how empty a lot of it is. You can pull off the road in Kansas or Nevada or Utah or Texas and stand in the quiet with only the wind for company and it seems as if civilization has already ended, that you&#x2019;re all alone on the planet. It&#x2019;s a wonderful and a terrifying feeling at the same time, and while I was writing the book, I decided I would travel every mile my characters did, in order to capture not only the details of place, but the feeling of place.<br><br> The writer Charles Baxter once said (more or less) that you know you&#x2019;ve come to the end of a story when you&#x2019;ve found a way to get your characters back to where they started. The end of <em>The Passage</em> is meant to create another beginning, and the space for book two to unfold.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your daughter was the spark that set your writing of <em>The Passage</em> in motion. What else drove you to delve into such an epic undertaking?<br> <b>A:</b> The other force at work was something more personal and writerly. One of the reasons that the story of <em>The Passage</em> had such a magnetic effect on me was that I felt myself reclaiming the impulses that led me to become a writer in the first place. Like my daughter, I was a big reader as a kid. I lived in the country, with no other kids around, and spent most of my childhood either with my nose in a book or wandering around the woods with my head in some imagined narrative or another. It was much later, of course, that I formally became a student of literature, and decided that writing was something I wanted to do professionally. But the groundwork was all laid back then, reading with a flashlight under the covers.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you have the narrative completely mapped out before you started, or did certain developments take you by surprise?<br> <b>A: </b> I had it mostly mapped out, but the book is in charge. I split and recombined some characters (mostly secondary ones.) I tend to think in terms of general narrative goals; the details work themselves out as you go, just so long as you remember the destination. And to that extent, the book followed the map I made with my daughter quite closely.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> When will we get to read the next book?<br> <b>A:</b> Two years (fingers wishfully crossed). </p> <br><b>Justin Cronin</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Passage,</i> <i>The Twelve, The City of Mirrors, Mary and O&#x2019;Neil</i> (which won the PEN/Hemingway Award and the Stephen Crane Prize), and <i>The Summer Guest</i>.

His work has been translated into forty-two languages. He lives near Charlottesville, Virginia.<p>&nbsp;<br> Chapter 1<br><br> Theodore Boone was an only child and for that reason usually had breakfast alone. His father, a busy lawyer, was in the habit of leaving early and meeting friends for coffee and gossip at the same downtown diner every morning at seven. Theo&#x2019;s mother, herself a busy lawyer, had been trying to lose ten pounds for at least the past ten years, and because of this she&#x2019;d convinced herself that breakfast should be nothing more than coffee with the newspaper. So he ate by himself at the kitchen table, cold cereal and orange juice, with an eye on the clock. The Boone home had clocks everywhere, clear evidence of organized people.&nbsp;<br><br> Actually, he wasn&#x2019;t completely alone. Beside his chair, his dog ate, too. Judge was a thoroughly mixed mutt whose age and breeding would always be a mystery. Theo had resï¿½cued him from near death with a last-second appearance in Animal Court two years earlier, and Judge would always be grateful. He preferred Cheerios, same as Theo, and they ate together in silence every morning.&nbsp;<br><br> At 8:00 a.m., Theo rinsed their bowls in the sink, placed the milk and juice back in the fridge, walked to the den, and kissed his mother on the cheek. &#x201c;Off to school,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you have lunch money?&#x201d; she asked, the same question five mornings a week.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Always.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;And your homework is complete?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect, Mom.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll see you when?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stop by the office after school.&#x201d; Theo stopped by the office every day after school, without fail, but Mrs. Boone always asked.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And remember to smile.&#x201d; The braces on his teeth had now been in place for over two years and Theo wanted desperately to get rid of them. In the meantime, though, his mother continually reminded him to smile and make the world a happier place.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m smiling, Mom.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Love you, Teddy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Love you back.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Theo, still smiling in spite of being called &#x201c;Teddy,&#x201d; flung his backpack across his shoulders, scratched Judge on the head and said good-bye, then left through the kitchen door. He hopped on his bike and was soon speeding down Mallard Lane, a narrow leafy street in the oldest section of town. He waved at Mr. Nunnery, who was already on his porch and settled in for another long day of watching what little traffic found its way into their neighborhood, and he whisked by Mrs. Goodloe at the curb without speaking because she&#x2019;d lost her hearing and most of her mind as well. He did smile at her, though, but she did not return the smile. Her teeth were somewhere in the house.&nbsp;<br><br> It was early spring and the air was crisp and cool. Theo pedaled quickly, the wind stinging his face. Homeroom was at eight forty and he had important matters before school. He cut through a side street, darted down an alley, dodged some traffic, and ran a stop sign. This was Theo&#x2019;s turf, the route he traveled every day. After four blocks the houses gave way to offices and shops and stores.&nbsp;<br><br> The county courthouse was the largest building in downtown Strattenburg (the post office was second, the library third). It sat majestically on the north side of Main Street, halfway between a bridge over the river and a park filled with gazebos and birdbaths and monuments to those killed in wars. Theo loved the courthouse, with its air of authority, and people hustling importantly about, and somber notices and schedules tacked to the bulletin boards. Most of all, Theo loved the courtrooms themselves. There were small ones where more private matters were handled without juries, then there was the main courtroom on the second floor where lawyers battled like gladiators and judges ruled like kings.&nbsp;<br><br> At the age of thirteen, Theo was still undecided about his future. One day he dreamed of being a famous trial lawyer, one who handled the biggest cases and never lost before juries. The next day he dreamed of being a great judge, noted for his wisdom and fairness. He went back and forth, changing his mind daily.&nbsp;<br><br> The main lobby was already busy on this Monday morning, as if the lawyers and their clients wanted an early start to the week. There was a crowd waiting by the elevator, so Theo raced up two flights of stairs and down the east wing where Family Court was held. His mother was a noted divorce lawyer, one who always represented the wife, and Theo knew this area of the building well. Since divorce trials were decided by judges, juries were not used, and since most judges preferred not to have large groups of spectators observing such sensitive matters, the courtroom was small. By its door, several lawyers huddled importantly, obviously not agreeing on much. Theo searched the hallway, then turned a corner and saw his friend.&nbsp;<br><br> She was sitting on one of the old wooden benches, alone, small and frail and nervous. When she saw him she smiled and put a hand over her mouth. Theo hustled over and sat next to her, very closely, knees touching. With any other girl he would have placed himself at least two feet away and prevented any chance of contact.&nbsp;<br><br> But April Finnemore was not just any girl. They had started prekindergarten together at the age of four at a nearby church school, and they had been close friends since they could remember. It wasn&#x2019;t a romance; they were too young for that. Theo did not know of a single thirteen-year-old boy in his class who admitted to having a girlfriend. Just the opposite. They wanted nothing to do with them. And the girls felt the same way. Theo had been warned that things would change, and dramatically, but that seemed unlikely.&nbsp;<br><br> April was just a friend, and one in a great deal of need at the moment. Her parents were divorcing, and Theo was extremely grateful his mother was not involved with the case.&nbsp;<br><br> The divorce was no surprise to anyone who knew the Finnemores. April&#x2019;s father was an eccentric antiques dealer and the drummer for an old rock band that still played in nightclubs and toured for weeks at a time. Her mother raised goats and made goat cheese, which she peddled around town in a converted funeral hearse, painted bright yellow. An ancient spider monkey with gray whiskers rode shotgun and munched on the cheese, which had never sold very well. Mr. Boone had once described the family as &#x201c;nontraditional,&#x201d; which Theo took to mean downright weird. Both her parents had been arrested on drug charges, though neither had served time.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; Theo asked.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I hate being here.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> She had an older brother named August and an older sister named March, and both fled the family. August left the day after he graduated from high school. March dropped out at the age of sixteen and left town, leaving April as the only child for her parents to torment. Theo knew all of this because April told him everything. She had to. She needed someone outside of her family to confide in, and Theo was her listener.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to live with either one of them,&#x201d; she said. It was a terrible thing to say about one&#x2019;s parents, but Theo understood completely. He despised her parents for the way they treated her. He despised them for the chaos of their lives, for their neglect of April, for their cruelty to her. Theo had a long list of grudges against Mr. and Mrs. Finnemore. He would run away before being forced to live there. He did not know of a single kid in town who&#x2019;d ever set foot inside the Finnemore home.&nbsp;<br><br> The divorce trial was in its third day, and April would soon be called to the witness stand to testify. The judge would ask her the fateful question, &#x201c;April, which parent do you want to live with?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> And she did not know the answer. She had discussed it for hours with Theo, and she still did not know what to say.&nbsp;<br><br> The great question in Theo&#x2019;s mind was, &#x201c;Why did either parent want custody of April?&#x201d; Each had neglected her in so many ways. He had heard many stories, but he had never repeated a single one.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;What are you going to say?&#x201d; he asked.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling the judge that I want to live with my aunt Peg in Denver.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought she said no.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;She did.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Then you can&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;What can I say, Theo?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;My mother would say that you should choose your mother. I know she&#x2019;s not your first choice, but you don&#x2019;t have a first choice.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;But the judge can do whatever he wants, right?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. If you were fourteen, you could make a binding decision. At thirteen, the judge will only consider your wishes. According to my mother, this judge almost never awards custody to the father. Play it safe. Go with your mother.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> April wore jeans, hiking boots, and a navy sweater. She rarely dressed like a girl, but her gender was never in doubt. She wiped a tear from her cheek, but managed to keep her composure. &#x201c;Thanks, Theo,&#x201d; she said.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I wish I could stay.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;And I wish I could go to school.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> They both managed a forced laugh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be thinking about you. Be strong.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks, Theo.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> His favorite judge was the Honorable Henry Gantry, and he entered the great man&#x2019;s outer office at twenty minutes after 8:00 a.m.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, good morning, Theo,&#x201d; Mrs. Hardy said. She was stirring something into her coffee and preparing to begin her work.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Morning, Mrs. Hardy,&#x201d; Theo said with a smile.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;And to what do we owe this honor?&#x201d; she asked. She was not quite as old as Theo&#x2019;s mother, he guessed, and she was very pretty. She was Theo&#x2019;s favorite of all the secretaries in the courthouse. His favorite clerk was Jenny over in Family Court.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I need to see Judge Gantry,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Is he in?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, yes, but he&#x2019;s very busy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Please. It&#x2019;ll just take a minute.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> She sipped her coffee, then asked, &#x201c;Does this have anything to do with the big trial tomorrow?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, it does. I&#x2019;d like for my Government class to watch the first day of the trial, but I gotta make sure there will be enough seats.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know about that, Theo,&#x201d; Mrs. Hardy said, frowning and shaking her head. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re expecting an overflow crowd. Seating will be tight.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Can I talk to the judge?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;How many are in your class?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Sixteen. I thought maybe we could sit in the balcony.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>She was still frowning as she picked up the phone and pushed a button. She waited for a second, then said, &#x201c;Yes, Judge, Theodore Boone is here and would like to see you. I told him you are very busy.&#x201d; She listened some more, then put down the phone. &#x201c;Hurry,&#x201d; she said, pointing to the judge&#x2019;s door.&nbsp;<br><br> Seconds later, Theo stood before the biggest desk in town, a desk covered with all sorts of papers and files and thick binders, a desk that symbolized the enormous power held by Judge Henry Gantry, who, at that moment, was not smiling. In fact, Theo was certain the judge had not cracked a smile since he&#x2019;d interrupted his work. Theo, though, was pressing hard with a prolonged flash of metal from ear to ear.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;State your case,&#x201d; Judge Gantry said. Theo had heard him issue this command on many occasions. He&#x2019;d seen lawyers, good lawyers, rise and stutter and search for words while Judge Gantry scowled down from the bench. He wasn&#x2019;t scowling now, nor was he wearing his black robe, but he was still intimidating. As Theo cleared his throat, he saw an unmistakable twinkle in his friend&#x2019;s eye.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir, well, my Government teacher is Mr. Mount, and Mr. Mount thinks we might get approval from the principal for an all-day field trip to watch the opening of the trial tomorrow.&#x201d; Theo paused, took a deep breath, told himself again to speak clearly, slowly, forcefully, like all great trial lawyers. &#x201c;But, we need guaranteed seats. I was thinking we could sit in the balcony.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, you were?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;How many?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Sixteen, plus Mr. Mount.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The judge picked up a file, opened it, and began reading as if he&#x2019;d suddenly forgotten about Theo standing at attenï¿½tion across the desk. Theo waited for an awkward fifteen seconds. Then the judge abruptly said, &#x201c;Seventeen seats, front balcony, left side. I&#x2019;ll tell the bailiff to seat you at ten minutes before nine, tomorrow. I expect perfect behavior.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;No problem, sir.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have Mrs. Hardy e-mail a note to your principal.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks, Judge.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You can go now, Theo. Sorry to be so busy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;No problem, sir.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Theo was scurrying toward the door when the judge said, &#x201c;Say, Theo. Do you think Mr. Duffy is guilty?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Theo stopped, turned around and without hesitating responded, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s presumed innocent.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Got that. But what&#x2019;s your opinion as to his guilt?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I think he did it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The judge nodded slightly but gave no indication of whether he agreed.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What about you?&#x201d; Theo asked.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a fair and impartial referee, Theo. I have no preconceived notions of guilt or innocence.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought you&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow.&#x201d; Theo cracked the door and husï¿½tled out.&nbsp;<br><br> Mrs. Hardy was on her feet, hands on hips, staring down two flustered lawyers who were demanding to see the judge. All three clammed up when Theo walked out of Judge Gantry&#x2019;s office. He smiled at Mrs. Hardy as he walked hurriedly by. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said as he opened the door and disappeared.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter 2<br><br> The ride from the courthouse to the middle school would take fifteen minutes if properly done, if one obeyed the traffic laws and refrained from trespassing. And normally this is the way Theo would do things, except when he was running a bit late. He flew down Market Street the wrong way, jumped the curb just ahead of a car, and bolted through a parking lot, used every sidewalk available, then&#x2014;his most serious offense&#x2014;he ducked between two houses on Elm Street. Theo heard someone yelling from the porch behind him until he was safely into an alley that ran into the teachers&#x2019; parking lot behind his school. He checked his watch&#x2014;nine minutes. Not bad.&nbsp;<br><br>He parked at the rack by the flagpole, secured his bike with a chain, then entered with a flood of kids who&#x2019;d just stepped off a bus. The eight forty bell was ringing when he walked into his homeroom and said good morning to Mr. Mount, who not only taught him Government but was his adviser as well.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Talked to Judge Gantry,&#x201d; Theo said at the teacher&#x2019;s desk, one considerably smaller than the one he&#x2019;d just left in the courthouse. The room was buzzing with the usual early morning chaos. All sixteen boys were present and all appeared to be involved in some sort of gag, scuffle, joke, or shoving match.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;And?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Got the seats, first thing in the morning.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent. Great job, Theo.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Mr. Mount eventually restored order, called the roll, made his announcements, and ten m...</p></p><h2>Barron&#39;s NYSTCE, 4th Edition: EAS / ALST / CSTs / edTPA (Barron&#39;s Test Prep NY)</h2><p><b>THIS BOOK FEATURES PRACTICE TESTS, JUST LIKE THE REAL TESTS, ALL WITH EXPLAINED ANSWERS.

When Moose's dad gets promoted to Associate Warden, despite being an unlikely candidate, it's a big deal. But the cons have a point system for targeting prison employees, and his dad is now in serious danger. After a fire starts in the Flanagan's apartment, Natalie is blamed, and Moose bands with the other kids to track down the possible arsonist. Then Moose gets a cryptic note from the notorious Al Capone himself. Is Capone trying to protect Moose's dad too? If Moose can't figure out what Capone's note means, it may be too late.<br><br>The last heart-pounding installment in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling, Newbery Honor-winning Alcatraz trilogy is not to be missed!<br><br>"Superlative historical fiction." -- <i>School Library Journal</i> (starred review for <i>Al Capone Shines My Shoes</i>)</p><p>Gennifer Choldenko is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling and Newbery Honor Award-winning author of ten children's books, including <i>Notes From a Liar and Her Dog</i>, <i>If a Tree Falls at Lunch Period</i>, <i>No Passengers Beyond this Point</i>, <i>Al Capone Does My Shirts</i>, <i>Al Capone Shines My Shoes</i>, and <i>Al Capone Does My Homework</i>.

The Warden&#x2019;s Son</b></p><p><b><i>Sunday, January 19, 1936</i></b></p><p>Today is my dad&#x2019;s first official day as associate warden on Alcatraz Island, home to anyone who is anyone in the criminal world. On our island we have world-famous robbers, thieves, swindlers, sharpshooters, second-story burglars, mad-dog murderers, plus a whole lot of ordinary criminals&#x2014;vicious but not well-known.</p><p>No one ever believes I live on Alcatraz. Even my eighth-grade history teacher made me write on the chalkboard <i>I do not live on Alcatraz</i> two hundred times. She didn&#x2019;t even apologize when she found out I wasn&#x2019;t lying.</p><p>My mother couldn&#x2019;t buy stockings at O&#x2019;Connor and Moffat&#x2019;s. They wouldn&#x2019;t take her check, on account of it said:&nbsp;<i>Helen Flanagan, Alcatraz Island, California</i>. My father had trouble getting his driver&#x2019;s license. They thought he was an escaped prisoner too stupid to fake his address, instead of an officer at the most notorious prison in North America.</p><p>My friend Annie was kicked out of Sunday school for saying she lived on Alcatraz. They sent her to confession. She confessed she didn&#x2019;t live on Alcatraz and the next day she confessed she&#x2019;d lied in confession.</p><p>Of course, Piper, the warden&#x2019;s daughter, never gets in trouble for anything. Nothing sticks to her. She&#x2019;s as slippery as a bar of soap.</p><p>I&#x2019;m betting a guard like Darby Trixle&#x2014;also known as Double Tough&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t have these kinds of problems either. Darby was born in a uniform, one size too tight. My dad, on the other hand, looks like a middle-age dance instructor. You&#x2019;d never expect him to carry a firearm. An accordion maybe, but not a rifle. Not that there are firearms everywhere on Alcatraz. Only up in the guard towers and the catwalks. At any given moment you are in the crosshairs down at the dock, but not up on the parade grounds.</p><p>My dad may not look the part, but as of today, he&#x2019;s the number two guy on the island. Piper lords it over all the kids that she&#x2019;s the warden&#x2019;s daughter, but now I&#x2019;m the&nbsp;<i>warden&#x2019;s son</i>. Okay, the associate warden&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but still.</p><p>In the kitchen, Dixieland band music is playing on the radio and my father is dressed in his crisp blue uniform. My mom is patiently trying to brush my sixteen-year-old sister Natalie&#x2019;s hair, which she really hates.</p><p>From a distance Nat seems normal, but when you get close you start to notice things are a bit off. She rocks from side to side. She drags her chin along her chest. She won&#x2019;t ever look in your eyes, and sometimes stares straight at your privates. My dad says Natalie views the world through her own personal kaleidoscope and it&#x2019;s our job to see from her perspective. That sounds good until she&#x2019;s counting every hairpin in the bathroom when my bladder is about to explode, or she&#x2019;s lying flat on the ground in the middle of the train station when the cutest girl in school walks by.</p><p>Today, Mom and Nat are waiting for Mrs. Kelly to arrive. Mrs. Kelly is the teacher who helps her learn the social graces.</p><p>&#x201c;You nervous?&#x201d; I ask my father as he sits on the edge of his bed, giving his shoes a last buff. His face is newly shaved, his skin smells of soap, and his shoes are as shiny as good silver spoons, but still he keeps shining them.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; my mother calls.</p><p>My father smiles as he slips his stocking feet into his shoes. &#x201c;See, I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; he says, smoothing down his hair and placing his officer&#x2019;s cap squarely on his head.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re nervous,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;Could be,&#x201d; he answers.</p><p>&#x201c;You want one of Nat&#x2019;s buttons&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for luck?&#x201d; Natalie collects buttons. She loves them the way I love baseball.</p><p>&#x201c;Think she could spare one?&#x201d;</p><p>I head back to the kitchen. &#x201c;Nat, Dad needs a button. Can you let him have one?&#x201d;</p><p>Nat&#x2019;s head is down, inches from her plate, her eyes focused on chasing the slippery whites of her egg. My mother glares at me. &#x201c;I just got her to sit down for breakfast.&#x201d;</p><p>Nat wiggles out of her chair and heads into the living room. A minute later she comes back with her hand tightly closed.</p><p>She walks up to my dad, who is gulping the last of his coffee, and opens her fist to reveal one flat, four-hole button.</p><p>My father beams at her. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a beaut, sweet pea,&#x201d; he says, sliding it into his pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;Ninety-seven,&#x201d; Nat says.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take good care of ninety-seven. You betcha. Guess I&#x2019;m all set now, except for one thing.&#x201d; He gives my mother an embarrassingly long kiss.</p><p>My mom smiles. &#x201c;Good luck,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>I follow him outside. He grins at me. &#x201c;Where do you think you&#x2019;re going? Think I can&#x2019;t handle the job on my own, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you can handle it,&#x201d; I say, though I am worried. My dad is too nice to be a warden.</p><p>I watch as he walks across the connecting balconies and turns the corner to the stairs. A minute later, he&#x2019;s down below, where eight cons are sweeping the dock. Darby Trixle&#x2019;s got his eye on them, barking orders through his bullhorn. He loves that bullhorn, sleeps with it under his pillow. Probably takes it to the bathroom with him too. I can just hear him: &#x201c;Bowel movement approaching.&#x201d;</p><p>I follow along after my dad down the stairs. Not close enough for him to notice. I don&#x2019;t want him to send me back home.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Darby.&#x201d; My father walks over for a chat.</p><p>Darby sucks his belly in and pokes his chest out. &#x201c;Good morning, boss,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>Will Darby be nice to me now that my dad is his boss?</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>My dad looks at all the prisoners as he talks to Darby. I know the names of some. There&#x2019;s #227, Lizard, a big woolly mammoth of a guy with a puffy face and spindly legs. Annie says he ate a lizard in the rec yard once&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how he got his name. There&#x2019;s #300, Count Lustig, a world-famous con man. And there&#x2019;s #141, Indiana, who has no chin and no eyebrows. Indiana waves at me when Darby isn&#x2019;t looking. But having a chinless, eyebrow-less felon wave at you is not fun, believe me.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not the only guy watching all of this either. Donny Caconi is on the 64 building phone, but his eyes are tracking the cons. Donny is the grown son of Mrs. Caconi, the lady who knocks on your door if the phone is for you. Since she weighs more than a river barge, and there are a lot of steps in 64 building, this is impressive. Mrs. Caconi&#x2019;s husband used to be a guard here, but he got transferred and she didn&#x2019;t go with him. Nobody knows why.</p><p>Donny is tall, thin, and graceful as a girl&#x2014;the opposite of his mother&#x2014;and he dresses snappy like he has loads of girlfriends. He nods his head at me as if I&#x2019;m his long-lost friend. Donny is everybody&#x2019;s long-lost friend. We all really like him.</p><p>Dad finishes his conversation and heads up the switchback.</p><p>Then I see Count Lustig motion to Darby. Darby rolls his eyes at the Count but walks his way. With Darby&#x2019;s back turned, Indiana spits on the dock behind my father. Lizard and another con with red hair laugh.</p><p>My father glances back at them, his brow furrowed. He knows something happened, but he&#x2019;s not sure what. He&#x2019;s too far up the road to do anything anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I&#x2019;m not.</p><p>A little voice in my head tells me this is not my business and I should stay out of it. But that little voice doesn&#x2019;t understand how I&#x2019;m the warden&#x2019;s son now, and I have to start acting like it.</p><p>My feet step over the white painted line that we&#x2019;re not supposed to cross when the cons are down here.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that!&#x201d; I tell Indiana in my most threatening voice, but I&#x2019;m so nervous, it comes out wibbly-wobbly.</p><p>Indiana looks at me with his chinless, eyebrow-less face. Lizard cocks his head toward Indiana as if to say&nbsp;<i>Take a look at that kid</i>.</p><p>Darby half walks, half runs toward me, his tight blue officer&#x2019;s jacket bristling. &#x201c;Get outta here.&#x201d; He waves me back in short angry motions.</p><p>&#x201c;He spit at my father,&#x201d; I say. But when I look at Indiana, his face is perfectly blank, like he doesn&#x2019;t speak our language.</p><p>&#x201c;Your father needs his kid to take care of him?&#x201d; Trixle barks.</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t see it. I did.&#x201d;</p><p>Trixle shakes his head, then waggles his finger at me. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what you see. You stay out of the dock area when the cons are down here, because I sure as heck don&#x2019;t need your help.&#x201d;</p><p>My arms are shaking and my legs feel like tapioca pudding. I retreat back across the line as fast as my shaky legs will take me.</p><p><br><br><b>2. America&#x2019;s Roughest Prison</b></p><p><b><i>Sunday, January 19, 1936</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Darby&#x2019;s a blowhard. Just ignore him,&#x201d; Donny says when he catches up to me on the parade grounds&#x2014;a big cement area in the middle level of the island where we play ball and roller skate and stuff.</p><p>Donny came up here just to talk to me?</p><p>Donny hasn&#x2019;t forgotten what it&#x2019;s like to be a kid, the way most grown-ups have. I wish he lived here all the time, but at least he visits a couple of days a week to get his laundry done. On Alcatraz, the convicts do our laundry, except for Mrs. Caconi&#x2019;s. She doesn&#x2019;t want convicts touching her clothes. But Donny doesn&#x2019;t care. He doesn&#x2019;t mind who does his laundry, so long as it isn&#x2019;t him.</p><p>&#x201c;Darby bugs me,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>Donny nods. &#x201c;Darby&#x2019;s a piece of work. He&#x2019;s got his sights on your dad. He was sure that job was his.&#x201d;</p><p>This is what I think too, but having an adult tell me in so many words&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that&#x2019;s another thing entirely.</p><p>&#x201c;You keep an eye out. He&#x2019;s a good man, your father, and I wouldn&#x2019;t want anything to happen to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wh-what are you worried will happen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in a tight spot is all. He&#x2019;s got the cons on one side testing him. And Darby on the other hankering for his job.&#x201d; Donny angles his hat over one eye. If my father tried that, he&#x2019;d look silly. Donny Caconi never looks silly.</p><p>&#x201c;Moose.&#x201d; My mom waves me down, half running toward us from the back side of 64 building. &#x201c;I need you home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now? I&#x2019;ve only been gone for five minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>Donny gives me a sly smile. &#x201c;I got a mother like that. Drives you crazy, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s so good to hear him say this. He knows just how I feel.</p><p>&#x201c;Better step to it. You know she isn&#x2019;t going to give up until she has you where she wants you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I get back to #2E, Nat is in the bathroom flushing the toilet once, twice, three times. Natalie goes to the Esther P. Marinoff, a boarding school for kids who are unusual the way she is. But, most weekends she gets to come home, and then I&#x2019;m responsible for her.</p><p>&#x201c;Natalie,&#x201d; I yell, &#x201c;quit it.&#x201d;</p><p>The flushing stops and she moves to her favorite part of every room: the light switch. On-off, on-off. She&#x2019;ll stand there until next Christmas if you let her.</p><p>&#x201c;No funny business,&#x201d; Mrs. Kelly says. Mrs. Kelly is the size of a gnome compared to my mom, who is tall and graceful. Nat comes out of the bathroom and begins to rock from one foot to the other, exploring her lip with her teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;We need your help with the eye contact situation,&#x201d; Mrs. Kelly informs me. She never says hello or how are you. She just launches right in with what she wants you to do. For a person who is supposed to teach the social graces, she is pretty darn abrupt.</p><p>Just once I wish she&#x2019;d ask about me and not only about Natalie. It&#x2019;s like I have <i>Natalie&#x2019;s brother</i> tattooed to my forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;We have to work twice as hard now, Moose. Natalie&#x2019;s the warden&#x2019;s daughter. She can&#x2019;t call attention to herself. She has to learn to blend in,&#x201d; my mom says.</p><p>Natalie blend in? Is she joking? &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t Nat work on eye contact at school?&#x201d; I offer.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s off this week, so I thought we could use this opportunity to work on this at home. You are such a nice young man. I knew you&#x2019;d help us.&#x201d; Mrs. Kelly smiles as if I&#x2019;ve already agreed.</p><p>Donny Caconi just got through telling me I need to watch out for my dad. How am I supposed to take care of him and Natalie too?</p><p>My mom&#x2019;s eyes are drilling into me. Clearly I&#x2019;m not leaving here until I do what they want.</p><p>&#x201c;Something with math,&#x201d; I suggest. &#x201c;We could make flash cards with long numbers written on them and hold them above our eyes. Natalie would have to look at the numbers while we&#x2019;re talking. She&#x2019;d get used to looking at people&#x2019;s eyes rather than at their shoes.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Kelly nods at my mother, then looks back to me. &#x201c;Get her in the habit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is that it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, maybe we can, you know, get her interested in counting eyebrow hairs or something.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Kelly doesn&#x2019;t crack a smile. She has the sense of humor of a fire hydrant. &#x201c;Flash cards might work.&#x201d; She nods. &#x201c;Want to give it a go?&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d;</i></p><p>Mrs. Kelly nods emphatically. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a way with her, Moose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Kelly&#x2019;s nostrils flare. &#x201c;Unless you can&#x2019;t be bothered.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It might not work,&#x201d; I respond lamely.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen to me, you are more important to Natalie than anyone else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>My mother is avoiding my eyes. Maybe I should put a card on my forehead for <i>her</i>.</p><p><i>DON&#x2019;T DO THIS TO ME </i>it would say<i>.</i></p><p>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; Mrs. Kelly asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Thirteen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sixty-two. Your mother is what?&#x201d; Mrs. Kelly turns to my mother.</p><p>&#x201c;Thirty-eight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do the math, Moose. You&#x2019;re going to know Natalie her whole life. We won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d; I mumble as I watch Natalie. She&#x2019;s rolled up in her favorite purple blanket, which is what she does when she gets upset.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It means you&#x2019;ll be around when we&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; Mrs. Kelly says in a voice tough as gristle.</p><p>&#x201c;Look. I&#x2019;ll do my best, but Natalie has to try. I can&#x2019;t make her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is important for her. She has to learn this.&#x201d; Mrs. Kelly doesn&#x2019;t even seem to hear me.</p><p>&#x201c;I said I&#x2019;d try,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Could I be excused now?&#x201d; I pounce on the door like it&#x2019;s a piece of chocolate cake.</p><p>My mom barely moves her head, but I take it as a yes. The door bangs behind me and I scoot across the balconies, up the stairs, to the switchback.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m headed for the warden&#x2019;s house.

Lacking cultural permission to acknowledge conflict, girls develop what Simmons calls "a hidden culture of silent and indirect aggression." <p> The author, who visited 30 schools and talked to 300 girls, catalogues chilling and heartbreaking acts of aggression, including the silent treatment, note-passing, glaring, gossiping, ganging up, fashion police, and being nice in private/mean in public. She decodes the vocabulary of these sneak attacks, explaining, for example, three ways to parse the meaning of "I'm fat." </p><p> Simmons is a gifted writer who is skilled at describing destructive patterns and prescribing clear-cut strategies for parents, teachers, and girls to resist them. "The heart of resistance is truth telling," advises Simmons. She guides readers to nurture emotional honesty in girls and to discover a language for public discussions of bullying. She offers innovative ideas for changing the dynamics of the classroom, sample dialogues for talking to daughters, and exercises for girls and their friends to explore and resolve messy feelings and conflicts head-on. </p><p> One intriguing chapter contrasts truth telling in white middle class, African-American, Latino, and working-class communities. <i>Odd Girl Out</i> is that rare book with the power to touch individual lives and transform the culture that constrains girls--and boys--from speaking the truth. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>REVISED AND UPDATED<br>WITH NEW MATERIAL ON CYBERBULLYING AND<br>HELPING GIRLS HANDLE THE DANGERS OF LIFE ONLINE<br><br>"Peels away the smiley surfaces of adolescent female society to expose one of girlhood's dark secrets: the vicious psychological warfare waged every day in the halls of our middle schools and high schools." &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>When <i>Odd Girl Out</i> was first published, it became an instant bestseller and ignited a long-overdue conversation about the hidden culture of female bullying.

The title of this book is Fists Full of Gold because that is what the author believes it can bring you. This new book is the most comprehensive prospecting book ever written. Its very different from what is on the market already. It&#39;s focus is to teach you how to find gold deposits, both placer and hard rock. There is a huge amount of information here that is just simply not available in any other prospecting book. It has plenty of basic coverage for new prospectors but lots of material for those guys who have some experience and want to learn more, plus even more advanced information for prospectors with decades of experience. It is up to date with all the latest technology and science. This book takes a unique and different approach in teaching the trade skills of prospecting it covers not just equipment, but the knowledge you really need to find those locations with recoverable gold. This information is important because in the final analysis, no matter well you operate your dredge, metal detector or other prospecting equipment, unless you can find the deposits where the gold is concentrated, your equipment cannot help you recover it. It&#39;s designed to be the one prospecting book you will never outgrow. It s a quite a reference: more than 360 pages long with over 225,000 words. That makes it longer by far than any other prospecting book written for individuals longer than any 2 or 3 of them combined! In spite of this, it s all written for the average individual who does not have any formal training in geology or mining. Fists Full Of Gold is a handbook of all types of gold prospecting with a very complete and up to date section on nugget detecting, as well as dry washing and even other topics like panning, slucing, dredging, etc. The book covers minerals, geology and how to do your own research in an understandable way that is not just for rank beginners. Many guys with 10 or even 20 years of experience looking for gold will learn a lot from this book. My book is different because it is brand new and up to date, explaining all the latest metal detector technology, current geologic knowledge, how to use GPS in prospecting, how to use the internet for research and other items of interest. Some of the highlights of the information contained in the book includes: The basics of prospecting and finding gold, including: The fact that there is lots of gold is still out there to be found How to use a gold pan, including crevicing, mossing and sniping for gold How to get the best recovery out of your sluice box or highbanker How to use a suction dredge to find and recover paystreaks How to operate a dry washer for gold An extensive section on metal detecting, perhaps the best on the market Building your own equipment: including building your own: Portable sluice box Lightweight suction dredge Desert dry washer How to operate a small scale commercial mining operation How to deal with and get the most out of your black sands How to get the best prices for your gold, specimens and nuggets A full coverage of the geology of gold and silver mineral deposits: All about minerals and how to identify them Minerals associated with gold deposits Rocks: what they are and how to identify them Basic geology for the prospector in an understandable form A detailed explanation of placer geology and how paystreaks form A detailed explanation of hard rock geology and how gold deposits form How to recognize many types of hard rock gold and silver deposits How to do research to find your own rich concentrations of gold. Using and understanding topographic maps, aerial photos and GPS, Where to find little known sources of information on gold deposits, How to use geology maps to find gold.</p><p>This book is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book on gold prospecting. Within its pages is everything you need to know to find gold today. Full of practical information and great illustrations, it is designed to be the one prospecting book you will never outgrow. Whether you are a beginner or have twenty years of prospecting experience, you will find a wealth of new information and tips in these pages. From equipment operations, to the geology of how gold deposits form, to the nature of coarse gold nuggets, this book takes a unique and different approach in teaching the &#x201c;trade skills&#x201d; of prospecting. It focuses primarily on the knowledge you need to find locations rich with recoverable gold. This is critical because in the final analysis, no matter how well you operate your dredge, metal detector or other prospecting equipment, unless you can find the places where gold is located, your equipment cannot help you recover it.The author is Chris Ralph, well known as a writer on gold prospecting. As far as his background and qualifications, Mr. Ralph has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mine Engineering from the Mackay School of Mines in Reno, and has been involved with individual prospecting for more than 30 years. He is also the Associate Editor of the ICMJ Prospecting and Mining Journal (what used to be the California Mining Journal), where he has been writing magazine articles on this topic for many years. There is no question he is very well qualified to write a book on how to prospect for and find gold.</p><h2>Sunflower House</h2><p>A charming tale about inventive children who plant some summer fun.<br></p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>.

Visit her website at www.kathrynhewitt.com.PreSchool-K?Another story about the life cycle of growing things?in this case, mammoth sunflowers?planted in a way that captures the imagination. A young boy plants the seeds in a large circle. He waters them and waits patiently until they grow taller than himself, with huge nodding blossoms that form a perfect "sunflower house." He and two friends play in the "house" all summer, even sleeping in it one night, until the leaves turn brown and the stems fall down. Then they fill their pockets with the seeds, the birds eat some, and the rest are left on the ground to grow again next summer. Bunting's idea is creative and charming, with poetic and romantic aspects. Unfortunately, the text, written in rhymed couplets, is not wholly successful. At times, the rhyme scheme seems strained and the meter becomes singsongy. The bright illustrations, done in watercolor and colored pencil, are reminiscent of this team's Flower Garden (Harcourt, 1994). They are realistic and add interesting details that extend the brief text. Despite its flaws, the book could spark an interest in the cycle of nature.?Virginia Golodetz, St. Michael's College, Winooski, VT<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Game of Lives (The Mortality Doctrine, Book Three)</h2><p><b>From James Dashner, author of the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling MAZE RUNNER series, comes&nbsp;the final book in the Mortality Doctrine series, an edge-of-your-seat cyber-adventure trilogy that includes&nbsp;<i>The Eye of Minds</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Rule of Thoughts</i>.&nbsp;</b><br><br> <b>Includes a sneak peek of&nbsp;<i>The Fever Code</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>the highly anticipated conclusion to the Maze Runner series&#x2014;the novel that finally reveals how the Maze was built! </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Michael used to live to game, but now, the games are over.

Not the happiest way to greet the conscious world.<br> &nbsp;<br> He sucked in a slow breath. He wished he&#x2019;d taken something for motion sickness. Sarah&#x2019;s dad seemed to think he was a NASCAR driver, and the road wasn&#x2019;t cooperating. Gerard the Gear Hound, the country&#x2019;s next great race-car superstar on the world&#x2019;s twistiest, most torn-up track.<br> &nbsp;<br> As they wound their way around the tight curves of the north Georgia mountains, Michael leaned into each turn with his entire body, as if that would somehow keep the car on the road. Lush foliage and trees overgrown with kudzu formed a great tunnel through a cave of green, sparkles of sunlight winking between leaves as they drove.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure she said Helga?&#x201d; Michael asked once again, his dream fresh in his mind. Go to the Hallowed Ravine. That&#x2019;s what she&#x2019;d said. Which meant, logically, that his own mind was telling him the same thing. They had to go back to the place where it all started if they wanted to end it. Seemed reasonable enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gerard, clutching the steering wheel as if he feared it might try to spin away from him, sighed at the question. His wife, Nancy, shifted in the passenger seat to face Michael.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said with a kind smile, then turned to the front again. Her patience made it seem as if that were the first time Michael had asked the question, though, in fact, it was probably the fifth or sixth.<br> &nbsp;<br> He sat in the middle of the backseat, Bryson to his left, Sarah to his right. No one had spoken much since their initial reunion. Between being chased down, imprisoned, and rescued, it had been a long several days, and everyone seemed as dazed as Michael. Michael himself didn&#x2019;t know what to think. Sarah&#x2019;s parents had been kidnapped, then rescued by a group of mystery people. Those same mystery people had then directed Gerard and Nancy to pick up their daughter and her friends and take them to an address in the Appalachian Mountains.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there&#x2019;d been something about Tangents. And a woman named Helga.<br> &nbsp;<br> It couldn&#x2019;t possibly be his nanny, Michael thought for the hundredth time. Could it? His Helga was gone--wasn&#x2019;t she? As far as he knew, she was a Tangent that had been decommissioned by Kaine, just like his parents. At the very least he&#x2019;d hastened their Decay. Real or not, their deaths had emptied his soul, and not much had filled it since.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah nudged him with her elbow, then awkwardly fell into him, her whole body pressing against his as Gerard whipped around yet another curve. The tires squealed and a flock of birds exploded from the foliage at the side of the road, screeching as they flew away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You okay, there?&#x201d; she asked, righting herself. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem very chipper for someone who just got broken out of jail.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael shrugged. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m still trying to put it all together.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thanks for the message you sent me,&#x201d; she whispered. While separated, both Michael and Sarah had hacked through the prison firewall systems to send notes to each other. &#x201c;It helped a lot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael nodded, gave a half smile. A horrible image formed in his mind--Sarah dying beside the lava pits, her last struggle for breath before exiting Kaine&#x2019;s Path in the deepest folds of the VirtNet. Michael had dragged her into all this. And her parents. And Bryson. It had broken his heart to see her in so much pain, and he couldn&#x2019;t stop wondering--did worse fates await them than virtual molten rock?<br> &nbsp;<br> Bryson leaned forward to look at them. &#x201c;Hey, no one sent me a message. That&#x2019;s not cool.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Michael said. &#x201c;I know how much you love your naps--I didn&#x2019;t want to interrupt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As if to rub it in, Sarah clicked her EarCuff, illuminating her NetScreen. Michael&#x2019;s message, We will win, hovered before them. A thrill of happiness warmed his chest to see that she&#x2019;d saved it there. He smiled, more than a little embarrassed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Real sweet.&#x201d; Bryson leaned back, eyeing Michael. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I haven&#x2019;t slept in, oh, about three weeks--which I blame you for, by the way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Blame accepted.&#x201d; Michael knew his friend was joking--mostly--but he still felt bad. Bryson might have never said something so simple and yet so perfectly true. The nausea from the roller-coaster driving suddenly shot up a few notches. &#x201c;Oh, man,&#x201d; he groaned. &#x201c;Sir? Uh . . . Gerard? Could we pull over a second? I&#x2019;m not feeling so well.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Turn toward Bryson,&#x201d; Sarah said, inching away from Michael. She rolled down the window. &#x201c;Does that help?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But her dad had already slowed--the sudden braking sending Michael&#x2019;s whirling stomach up another notch--and was pulling into a little patch of dirt on the side of the narrow road.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There you go, son,&#x201d; the man announced. He seemed familiar enough with the maneuver that Michael was sure it wasn&#x2019;t the first time he&#x2019;d driven someone to the brink of losing their lunch. &#x201c;But hurry--we&#x2019;re already late.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah&#x2019;s mom smacked her husband on the arm lightly. &#x201c;Have a heart, honey. For heaven&#x2019;s sake. No one likes to throw up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael was already climbing over Sarah. He opened the door and jumped out of the car before she could complain. His horrible prison breakfast was coming up, and there was no stopping it. He found the closest bush and gave it a very unpleasant surprise.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Where&#39;s Boo?

Do you sometimes hold a grudge? Are you always on the lookout for treasure? You might be a DWARF!<br><br> <b>Age</b><br>Dwarves are recognized as adults by age twenty, but are still considered &#x201c;young&#x201d; until age fifty. They live to an&nbsp;average age of 350 years.<br><br> <b>Size</b><br>Adult dwarves stand&nbsp;four to five feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds.<br><br> Stout and endlessly loyal, dwarves are a people who value&nbsp;tradition and the bonds of clan and family. They are short but strong as well as resilient due to a harsh life on the mountains, making them quite adept for their demanding work as miners.<br><br> Dwarven culture is built around mining. Its rewards inform why dwarves have such a powerful appreciation for the splendor of gold and jewels (and the value of solid iron weapons), and its challenges explain why they form such tight-knit communities that are often hostile to possible rivals, most notably goblins and orcs.<br><br> Dwarves can be stubborn and single-minded, which means feuds between rival clans can last for generations. Dwarves that bring their crafting skills to cities far from home will never forget where they come from. In fact, honoring a clan tradition or avenging an ancient wrong are common reasons for dwarves to head out on&nbsp;adventures, though they might also go exploring for the sake of personal glory, in service to one of their industrious gods, or simply for the chance to get more gold!<br><b><br>Dwarvven Feuds</b><br>Dwarves have a strong sense of justice and deep loyalty to their clan traditions. A wrong done to one dwarf is considered a slight against the entire clan, which means one insult, if not apologized for quickly enough, can become a full-blown clan feud lasting for generations.<br><br><b> Attributes</b><br><b> Tough</b> Physically robust, dwarves&nbsp;can take a lot of hits, and they have a natural resistance to poison.<br><b> <br>Handy</b> Dwarves love to develop their expertise in certain crafts, whether it&#x2019;s forging weapons or cutting stone. They know the tools of their trade inside out.<br><b> <br>Strong</b> Dwarves that live in tough&nbsp;terrain, like cold and rugged mountains, are particularly noted for their physical strength.<br><b> <br>Wise</b> Dwarves that live in less hostile terrain tend to be highly perceptive. Away from the shelter of their mines, they&#x2019;ve learned to keep their wits about them.</p><h2>Warriors Manga: SkyClan and the Stranger: 3 Full-Color Warriors Manga Books in 1</h2><p><p><strong>A full-color collection of three manga adventures from the world of Erin Hunter&#x2019;s Warriors series&#x2014;never before available in color!</strong></p><p>This epic volume contains all three books in the SkyClan and the Stranger trilogy: <em>The Rescue</em>, <em>Beyond the Code</em>, and <em>After the Flood</em>. </p><p>Newleaf is coming, and Leafstar is proud to see SkyClan thriving under her leadership.

You feel it deep down in your bones. Apathy is your nemesis and your hunger to change the world keeps you up at night. But no matter how deep this hunger growls, we can only make a meaningful impact if we are rooted in Jesus. And here&#x2019;s the thing:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>God is not interested in developing your vision first.</b><br> <b>He is interested in developing you.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> In Rooted, Banning Liebscher takes us to the life of David to show how God expands our root system in the hidden places before leading us to where we all desire to go, the visible world. It was in a field of prayerful devotion, a season of serving, and a cave of community that God prepared David for his crown, the same way God prepares us. Take a look at your own life. Are you embracing God&#x2019;s process, the sometimes painstaking and maddening process? When we can release ourselves to God we will find that we can thrive while He develops us, rather than succumb to discouragement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever your age or season of life, it takes immense courage to slow down enough to let God grow a root system in your life so that you can bear fruit that remains. You are where you are because God has planted you there. Discover what it looks like to embrace His process so you can do what He has called you to, change the world.</p><p>Banning Liebscher was on staff at Bethel Church in Redding, California for eighteen years and founded the ministry Jesus Culture during that time. Banning and his family, along with the Jesus Culture team, relocated to the capital of California where they started a church, Jesus Culture Sacramento. Their vision is to see people encounter God, be empowered in community, and engage their city for revival and transformation. He and his wife, SeaJay, have three children.<b>Rooted&nbsp;<br></b><br>I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me&nbsp;and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you&nbsp;can do nothing. . . . You did not choose me, but I chose&nbsp;you and appointed you so that you might go and bear&nbsp;fruit&#x2014;fruit&nbsp;that will last. (verses 5, 16, niv)&nbsp;<br><br>If you are a follower of Jesus, then your calling and destiny&nbsp;are to be fruitful. Fruit is not a bunch of spiritual or religious activities&nbsp;like going to church, reading your Bible, keeping the Ten&nbsp;Commandments, or even preaching the gospel. Fruit means that&nbsp;when people taste your life, you taste like Jesus. If you are fully&nbsp;grafted into Jesus, the vine, then He says your life should produce&nbsp;tangible results that make people say, &#x201c;Now that is Christlike.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Not only are you chosen and appointed to produce fruit, but&nbsp;Jesus said you are chosen to produce much fruit, and not only&nbsp;much fruit, but fruit that lasts. There&#x2019;s a difference between some&nbsp;fruit and much fruit. God&#x2019;s plan for your life is not conservative.&nbsp;He&#x2019;s not satisfied with minimal results. He expects to see much,&nbsp;and you should too. How much do you think you can know Jesus&nbsp;and become like Him? How much do you think you can show&nbsp;Him to the world? He wants that for you and much more. He&nbsp;wants you to bear fruit beyond what you could ask or think.&nbsp;<br><br>There&#x2019;s also a difference between much fruit and fruit that&nbsp;will last. God isn&#x2019;t satisfied with temporary results. He&#x2019;s in the&nbsp;business of permanent change. He&#x2019;s not looking for a month, or a&nbsp;year or a decade, of you growing more like Jesus and pursuing the&nbsp;things He calls you to do. He&#x2019;s looking for a lifetime impact, a&nbsp;generational impact, and an eternal impact.&nbsp;<br><br>Abundant, enduring fruitfulness is the mandate on your life.&nbsp;Ultimately, enduring fruitfulness in your life and the rest of the&nbsp;body of Christ is the key to seeing nations transformed, cities impacted,&nbsp;and culture shaped. But abundant, enduring fruitfulness&nbsp;will only happen, Jesus says, if you &#x201c;remain in&#x201d; Him. What does&nbsp;that mean?&nbsp;<br><br><b>Roots Before Fruit</b>&nbsp;<br>In the growth cycle of fruit-bearing&nbsp;plants, fruit comes at the very&nbsp;end. The cycle starts with a seed being planted in the ground.&nbsp;When watered, the seed will break open and begin to put down&nbsp;roots. That root system will continue to grow as the seed forms a&nbsp;shoot and eventually breaks through the surface of the soil into air&nbsp;and sunlight. Both the plant and its root system will keep growing&nbsp;until the plant is strong and mature enough to bear fruit.&nbsp;Significantly, in order for a plant to survive, much less bear fruit,&nbsp;its root system has to take up more space underground than the&nbsp;plant takes up above ground. When you look up at one of those&nbsp;immense redwoods in the Avenue of the Giants, for example,&nbsp;you&#x2019;re actually standing on root systems that are wider than those&nbsp;trees are tall. This is the principle of foundations. A foundation&nbsp;always has to be bigger than the thing it is supporting.&nbsp;<br><br>Fruitfulness in your life comes about through a similar process.&nbsp;God plants the seed of His word inside you (see Luke 8:11)&nbsp;and waters it with His Holy Spirit, bringing it to life. He begins to&nbsp;give you insight into who He created you to be in Him and what&nbsp;He is calling you to do with Him. He stirs up that desire in you&nbsp;to have a lasting impact in the world. And then He starts to build&nbsp;a root system for that seed in your heart, your internal world.&nbsp;<br><br>Your heart is your point of connection with Jesus&#x2014;the&nbsp;place&nbsp;where you become rooted in your relationship with Him. He&nbsp;wants to develop His heart-to-heart&nbsp;connection with you to the&nbsp;point where you become fully united with Him, where you think&nbsp;like He thinks, want what He wants, speak like He speaks, and do&nbsp;what He does. This is what it means to remain in Him. Only&nbsp;when you remain in Him will you produce fruit that lasts.&nbsp;<br><br>For you to bear abundant, enduring fruit, God needs to make&nbsp;you bigger on the inside than you are on the outside. You have to&nbsp;let Him build your root system in secret before He leads you into&nbsp;making a visible impact in the world. In his book Power Through&nbsp;Prayer, E. M. Bounds, one of the foremost authors on prayer, said,&nbsp;&#x201c;The man&#x2014;God&#x2019;s&nbsp;man [and woman]&#x2014;is&nbsp;made in the closet.&nbsp;His life and his profoundest convictions were born in his secret&nbsp;communion with God.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b>David&#x2019;s Root System&nbsp;</b><br>If you study in Scripture those who had a lasting impact, you will&nbsp;find that God led them through a season of preparation. For Joseph,&nbsp;that season lasted about thirteen years. Moses had to spend&nbsp;forty years shepherding in the wilderness before he was ready to&nbsp;lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Jesus Himself spent thirty years&nbsp;preparing for His three years of ministry&#x2014;the&nbsp;most impactful&nbsp;ministry in history.&nbsp;<br><br>Of all the people in the Bible who bore lasting fruit, however,&nbsp;<br>David is unique, not just because of his incredible legacy, but also&nbsp;because of the depth of insight the Bible gives us into how God&nbsp;established roots in David&#x2019;s life.&nbsp;<br><br>The highlights of David&#x2019;s legacy are so impressive that a whole&nbsp;book on them wouldn&#x2019;t do them justice. Within his lifetime, he&nbsp;ushered in the golden age of Israel and established a brand-new&nbsp;culture of worship in the nation. Beyond his lifetime, the blessing&nbsp;on David&#x2019;s throne affected God&#x2019;s dealings with every king of Israel&nbsp;and Judah who came after him. The promised Messiah, Jesus, is&nbsp;called the Son of David and sits on the throne of David (see Luke&nbsp;1:32). The psalms David wrote became a central part of worship&nbsp;for Jews and, later, Christians. In other words, every day for thousands&nbsp;of years, millions of people around the world have quoted,&nbsp;prayed, meditated on, and worshiped God with David&#x2019;s words.&nbsp;Finally, David was a prototype of New Testament believers, particularly&nbsp;because of his unique intimacy with God and his understanding&nbsp;that God desired a pure heart more than &#x201c;sacrifice and&nbsp;offering&#x201d; (Psalm 40:6). <br><br>Every person on the planet, especially&nbsp;every Christian, has been impacted by the life of David. <br><br>He bore&nbsp;lasting fruit that continues to this day and will continue into&nbsp;eternity.&nbsp;<br><br>Yet we can trace all of that fruit back to a single moment, the&nbsp;moment in which God planted a seed in David&#x2019;s life. This moment&nbsp;took place when he was young&#x2014;probably&nbsp;between ten and&nbsp;thirteen years old&#x2014;and&nbsp;it was pretty dramatic. The prophet Samuel,&nbsp;who at that time in Israel was like Billy Graham, the president,&nbsp;and Bono all wrapped into one, showed up at David&#x2019;s house&nbsp;and announced that he had come to anoint the next king of Israel.&nbsp;<br><br> David&#x2019;s dad, Jesse, didn&#x2019;t even think to call David in from the&nbsp;field, because Jesse naturally assumed that his youngest could not&nbsp;be the one destined for kingship when David had far more suitable&nbsp;older brothers to fill the role. Samuel surveyed Jesse&#x2019;s tall,&nbsp;handsome sons and thought, <br>One of these has to be the king. Yet&nbsp;one by one, each of David&#x2019;s seven brothers stood before Samuel,&nbsp;and the prophet heard the Lord say, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not the one.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>In the midst of this selection process, the Lord spoke a word&nbsp;to Samuel that we often pull out and quote: &#x201c;The Lord does not&nbsp;look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance,&nbsp;but the Lord looks at the heart&#x201d; (1 Samuel 16:7, niv).&nbsp;God was saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for someone who will let Me grow&nbsp;him on the inside before I grow him on the outside.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;want another King Saul. Saul looked like a king, but he wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp;sufficiently rooted in God&#x2019;s heart to lead a nation in God&#x2019;s way.&nbsp;God wanted a man He could groom for the kingship from a&nbsp;young age, a man who would actually last in that role for a lifetime&nbsp;and establish the nation on a firm foundation of faithfulness&nbsp;to God.&nbsp;<br><br>None of Jesse&#x2019;s older sons had what God was looking for. So&nbsp;the prophet asked, &#x201c;Did we miss anyone?&#x201d; They reluctantly called&nbsp;their little brother in from the field, and when Samuel saw him, he&nbsp;said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the king.&#x201d; He anointed David with oil, and the&nbsp;Holy Spirit came on David in power, watering the seed of God&#x2019;s&nbsp;word and causing it to grow (see verse 13).&nbsp;<br>From that point, God began to build David&#x2019;s roots&#x2014;a&nbsp;journey&nbsp;we will be exploring in more detail throughout this book.&nbsp;Only when that journey was complete did God&#x2019;s word come true:&nbsp;<br><br>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at&nbsp;Hebron, the king made a covenant with them at Hebron&nbsp;before the Lord, and they anointed David king over&nbsp;Israel.&nbsp;<br>David was thirty years old when he became king,&nbsp;and he reigned forty years. (2 Samuel 5:3&#x2013;4,&nbsp;niv)&nbsp;<br><br>Thirty years old! You do the math. God took somewhere between&nbsp;seventeen and twenty years to build roots in David and get&nbsp;him ready to bear visible fruit.&nbsp;<br><br><b>A Passion for Roots&nbsp;</b><br>My early twenties were a season of seed planting in my life. At the&nbsp;time, I was serving as youth pastor at Bethel Church in Redding,&nbsp;California, where exciting things were happening. By the hundreds,&nbsp;people were coming to know God, coming back to God,&nbsp;receiving healing of their hearts, minds, and bodies, and being&nbsp;filled with incredible joy and hunger for more of Him. The environment&nbsp;seemed to stir and awaken people&#x2019;s hopes and dreams&nbsp;for what God wanted to do in and through their lives. It showed&nbsp;up in our sermons, our prayers, our worship songs, and our&nbsp;conversations&#x2014;everyone&nbsp;was catching a vision for something&nbsp;God was calling them to do.&nbsp;<br><br>I was no different. I dreamed about the impact I would have&nbsp;on the world. Practically every minister who came through town&nbsp;and preached at our church called me out in meetings to confirm&nbsp;what God was calling me to do and pray things over me regarding&nbsp;<br>my future. It felt like I was being barraged with encouraging words&nbsp;from people about my destiny. It was both exhilarating and terrifying&nbsp;to grab hold of the vision God was building in my heart and&nbsp;say, &#x201c;Yes, God! Let&#x2019;s do this!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Funny enough, however, no one praying over me added, &#x201c;By&nbsp;the way, it will be twenty years before you start to scratch the surface&nbsp;of the things I&#x2019;m telling you about.&#x201d; I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed&nbsp;them if they had. I was passionate and committed. I thought I was&nbsp;ready to step into the vision and be fruitful!&nbsp;<br><br>I now recognize that what I thought was readiness was actually&nbsp;the Holy Spirit coming into my life to water the seeds that&nbsp;were being planted and causing them to start forming roots. <br><br>The&nbsp;vision God put in my heart was, in fact, to serve and equip believers&nbsp;to impact cities and nations for the kingdom. I wanted to be&nbsp;part of leading a generation to make Jesus famous and to shift our&nbsp;culture by putting His love and truth on display. The problem was&nbsp;that I did not yet understand what lasting impact was or how God&nbsp;brings it about. I hadn&#x2019;t really discovered the biblical model for&nbsp;how God prepares us for fruitfulness. When I read the stories of&nbsp;Abraham, Joseph, David, and other great saints, as well as Jesus&nbsp;Himself, and saw how long it took them to get where they were&nbsp;going, I thought, Twenty years? You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me!&nbsp;<br><br>Thankfully, both for my sake and the sake of those I was leading&nbsp;and equipping as a pastor, God shifted my perspective and&nbsp;showed me how critical it is for Him to build us on the inside first.&nbsp;The more I studied, observed, and experienced, the more it became&nbsp;clear to me that lasting fruit only comes through the long&nbsp;journey of putting our roots down deep in Jesus. Without deep&nbsp;<br>roots, there is no fruit, and if there is fruit, it&#x2019;s not the kind that&nbsp;lasts.&nbsp;<br><br>My passion for roots has especially grown from watching&nbsp;what happens to people who are rootless. Jesus described them in&nbsp;the parable of the sower:&nbsp;<br>But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear,&nbsp;receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who&nbsp;believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.&nbsp;Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when&nbsp;they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches,&nbsp;and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. (Luke&nbsp;8:13&#x2013; 14)&nbsp;<br><br>These people initially received the word with joy. They had a&nbsp;sense of excitement and anticipation for the vision God had&nbsp;planted in their hearts. Yet they did not allow the Gardener to&nbsp;come in and remove the rocks and weeds from the soil of their&nbsp;hearts. They did not allow Him to cultivate roots in their lives,&nbsp;and as a result, the word either died off or never bore any lasting&nbsp;fruit.&nbsp;<br><br>In the last twenty years, my position as a leader has grown&nbsp;from youth pastor to director of a worship-conference&nbsp;movement&nbsp;(Jesus Culture) to lead pastor of a church (Jesus Culture Sacramento).&nbsp;In these roles I have had the privilege of interacting with&nbsp;so many people who are trying to navigate their journeys of&nbsp;growth in God. I can tell you that as a pastor, nothing is more&nbsp;heartbreaking than watching the seed of passion and vision either&nbsp;<br>die off or be strangled in people who were once running hard after&nbsp;God. Sadly, I have watched many Christians over the years fall&nbsp;into compromise, give up on their calling, or walk away from <br>God&nbsp;entirely because they never allowed Him to make their internal&nbsp;world a place where His word could thrive.&nbsp;<br><br>On the other hand, nothing is more thrilling and satisfying&nbsp;than watching people who choose to yield, to embrace the journey&nbsp;of learning to remain in Christ and let Him establish their root&nbsp;system in secret. There is something truly supernatural about these&nbsp;people and what comes out of their lives. They taste like Jesus.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Redefining Success&nbsp;</b><br>When I was in my teens and twenties, I was amazed when people&nbsp;set out to run after their dreams or pursue a call from God. I celebrated&nbsp;their passion and faith to step out and risk everything for&nbsp;Him. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. I still celebrate those moments and&nbsp;cheer people on as they start running their race. But I no longer&nbsp;have the same sense of awe and anticipation in those moments&nbsp;because I&#x2019;ve realized something.&nbsp;<br><br>Anybody can start a race.&nbsp;<br><br>The real question over our lives is not how strong we will&nbsp;begin our race to pursue God&#x2019;s call but how strong we will finish&nbsp;it. There are far fewer finishers out there than beginners....</p><h2>A More Complete Beast</h2><p><p>A More Complete Beast is men's writer Jack Donovan's third book in a series that started with the runaway cult hit, The Way of Men. The second book, Becoming a Barbarian, showed disconnected modern men - men born into the anti-identity "Empire of Nothing" - how to think tribally. In A More Complete Beast, Donovan picks up Friedrich Nietzsche's thoughts on nobility and master morality and uses them to guide men through an "upside-down" modern world, avoid the trap of hateful ressentiment, and overcome adversity through creativity. In Donovan's hands, Nietzsche's words are rasps and chisels to help men refine a strength-based ethos, reveal their highest and noblest selves and become more complete men. And, as Nietzsche reminded us, man is a beast - so to become a more complete man is always to become a more complete beast.</p></p><p></p><h2>Instant Pot Fast &amp; Easy: 100 Simple and Delicious Recipes for Your Instant Pot</h2><p><b>Fully authorized by Instant Pot&#x2014;brand new recipes from the best-selling author of <i>Indian Instant Pot Cookbook </i>and</b><i><b> The Keto Instant Pot Cookbook</b></i><br><br><i>Indian Instant Pot Cookbook </i>by Urvashi Pitre&nbsp;is already one of the top-selling cookbooks in its category.

He authored several books, which include the topics of waves, geology, archaeology, poetry, and oceanography. In his book <i>Deep Water, Ancient Ships<i> he first proposed the hypothesis that anoxic water in the Black Sea would preserve ancient Black Sea shipwrecks. He led the first test drillings for Project Mohole, and was project director from 1960-1962. Bascom was a consultant to the Advisory Committee on Government Organization. He also served as the Technical Director of the Advisory Committee on Civil Defense of the National Academy of Science and National Research Council. He is the original author of <i>Waves and Beaches</i>, originally published in 1963 and reissued in 1979 (Anchor).</i></i></p><p><b>Prologue</b><br><br></p><p>Is there anyone who can watch without fascination the struggle for supremacy between sea and land?<br><br></p><p>The sea attacks relentlessly, marshaling the force of its powerful waves against the land&#x2019;s strongest points. It collects the energy of distant winds and transports it across thousands of miles of open ocean as quietly rolling swell. On nearing shore this calm disguise is suddenly cast off, and the waves rise up as angry breakers, hurling themselves against the land in a final furious assault. Turbulent water, green and white, is flung against sea cliffs and forced into the cracks between the rocks to dislodge them. When the pieces fall the churning water grinds them against each other to form sand; the sand already on the beach melts away before the onslaught.<br><br></p><p>But the land defends itself with such subtle skill that often it will gain ground in the face of the attack. Sometimes it will trade a narrow zone of high cliff for a whole low beach. Or it may use some of its beach material in a flanking maneuver to seal off arms of the sea that have recklessly reached between the headlands. The land constantly straightens its front to present the least possible shoreline to the sea&#x2019;s onslaught.<br><br></p><p>When the great storm waves come, the beach will temporarily retreat, slyly deploying part of its material in a sandy underwater bar that forces the waves to break prematurely and spend their energies in futile foam and turbulence before they reach the main coast. When the storm subsides, the small waves that follow contritely return the sand to widen the beach again. Rarely can either of the antagonists claim a permanent victory.<br><br></p><p>This shifting battleground is the surf zone and the beach face. The two combatants continue their battle in a coastal world that exists at the whim of a grander empire; now swept with the winds of Climate Change; their battleground is shifting, rising with a sea level not seen for millennia. This is their story in the 21st Century.|</p><p><b>Preface to the Third Edition</b><br><br></p><p>Big whorls have little whorls,<br> </p><p>which feed on their velocity<br></p><p>And little whorls have lesser whorls,<br> </p><p>and so on to viscosity.&#x201d; - L. F. Richardson<br></p><p>This Third Edition of <i>Waves and Beaches</i> celebrates the ongoing relationship of the sea and the land in the 21st Century. The nature of breaking waves and beach formation have not changed; the heat of the Sun creates the wind and its energy lives as a wave until it dies upon the shore. However our measurement techniques, instrumentation and interactions with the waves have changed. The number of surfers, divers and people living in the coastal areas have all grown immensely. The size of ships and the number of offshore structures have grown into a web of international commerce which influences all humans. These changes now affect urban planning, large scale funding and political decision making - all upon a rising sea level. By understanding the origins of such dynamics, societies can respond to coastal changes and manage the expectations and wellbeing of its members.<br><br></p><p>The Cascade of Wave Energy <br></p><p>This third edition of <i>Waves and Beaches</i> also expands its scope with understanding of the changing waves of cascading energy affecting our planet.<br><br></p><p>In the Beginning, the first release of energy was immense; tumbling whorling waves of energy radiated outward. Subatomic particles paired with partners and organized into elements. Those elements courted companion elements and spawned chemical compounds. As the universe swirled, gravity cleverly gathered matter into galaxies, formed spinning solar systems beaded with planets, ours has been gifted and shielded by water.<br><br></p><p>All of the Earth, its waters, land and atmosphere are beating with wave energy. It is part of a marvelous display of the ebb and flow of energy since creation &#x2013; since the 'big bang' if you prefer. For billions of years, waves of energy, juggled by gravity, have continually heated and cooled; stirring our planet's geology, chemical brews, atmosphere and waters. <br><br></p><p>Water stabilizes our climate. It takes energy to change ridgid water (ice) into flowing liquid. It takes even more energy to change liquid water to a cloud of gas (water vapor). Earth's great seasonal harmonies are subtle balances in the amounts of water, ice and water vapor. This stability has aided civilization for most of the last four thousand years.<br><br></p><p>Before that time, histories of changing climate are contained in the Polar ice-cores from both Greenland and Antarctica. These histories contain waves of warm and cold climate, each closely related to the amounts and types of gasses in our atmosphere. Closer to the Equator, a million years of coral reefs, oceanic sediments, tree rings and plant pollen data all tell us matching stories &#x2013; it is an irrefutable narrative of our planet's ancient oceanic circulation and atmospheric weather patterns.<br><br></p><p>A cascading flow of energy connects everything. It influences the formation of continenents, earthquakes, the strength of the sun's rays, volcanic eruptions, the amount of ice, sea level, human population dynamics, types of atmospheric gasses, ocean circulation patterns, seasons, the warm-cold meanders of the jet stream, winds, ocean waves, beach erosion and sand formation. All are interlinked and essential.<br><br></p><p>These essential roles have been disrupted by rapid population growth, the use of fossil fuels, damming rivers, changing sediment loads, diverting the flow of water through estuaries and deltas as we contaminate aquifers with chemical pollutants. There is no alibi. The world's oceans are experiencing more intense hurricanes, rising sea levels, coastal erosion, storm surges and saltwater intrusion into our freshwater aquifers. The waves and beaches of the world are elevating their battle during this swiftly transforming era, the most turbulent time since the 'rise of humanity'.<br><br></p><p>This third edition of <i>Waves and Beaches</i> will help you take action.<br><br> &#x201c;Gravity is the viscus force of the universe; culture is the viscous force of civilization.&#x201d; &#x2013; KMC</p></p><h2>ï¿½Debo compartir mi helado?-An Elephant and Piggie Book, Spanish Edition</h2><p>Gerald is careful.

Brought up in a well-to-do upper-middle-class family, who had sent her to Cambridge and the Sorbonne and hoped that she would go into law, the young woman defied their wishes and set her sights on being an artist. Her introduction to Picasso led to a friendship, a love affair, and a relationship of ten years, during which Gilot gave birth to Picasso&#x2019;s two children, Paloma and Claude. Gilot was one of Picasso&#x2019;s muses; she was also very much her own woman, determined to make herself into the remarkable painter she did indeed become.<br><br><i>Life with Picasso </i>is an indispensable record of his thinking about art, as well as an often very funny account of his relationships with other artists and with dealers and hangers-on.&nbsp; It is also about Franï¿½oise Gilot. This is a brilliant self-portrait of a young woman of enormous talent and exacting intelligence figuring out who she wants to be.</p><p><b>Franï¿½oise Gilot&nbsp;</b>is a French painter, critic, and writer. Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France,&nbsp;she&nbsp;began writing and painting at a young age. In 1938, she graduated from the Sorbonne with a BA in&nbsp;philosophy and in 1939 from Cambridge University with a degree in English. In 1943, when Gilot was&nbsp;twenty-one, she met Pablo Picasso, who was&nbsp;sixty-one, and theyhad two children, Claude and Paloma. Their relationship lasted ten years, and Gilot published the bestselling&nbsp;<i>Life with Picasso&nbsp;</i>eleven years after their separation. In 1970,&nbsp;she&nbsp;married Jonas Salk, who pioneered the polio vaccine, and they remained married until his death in 1995.

For many people, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Glacier National Park, and other iconic American wildlands exist in the mind's eye as Ansel Adams photographs. The legendary photographer explored more than forty national parks in his lifetime, producing some of the most indelible images of the natural world ever made. One of the twentieth century's most ardent champions of the park and wilderness systems, Adams also helped preserve additional natural areas and protect existing ones through his photographs, essays, and letter-writing campaigns.<br> <br> Edited and with commentary by Andrea G. Stillman, the foremost expert on Adams' work, this landmark publication includes quotations by Adams on the making of numerous photographs and essays by Wallace Stegner, William A. Turnage of The Ansel Adams Trust, and journalist and critic Richard B. Woodward. This is a must-own for Ansel Adams fans and all those who, like Adams, treasure America's wilderness.<br></p><p>Andrea G. Stillman, who worked with Adams in the 1970s, has edited several books of his photographs and writings, including <i>Letters And Images: 1916-1984</i>, <i>Our National Parks</i>, and <i>Ansel Adams In Color</i>.<br> <br>Journalist, documentary filmmaker, and critic Richard B.

Where so many companies encourage a dog eat dog mentality, the Kaplan Thaler Group has succeeded through chocolate and flowers. In <i>The Power of Nice,</i> through their own experiences and the stories of other people and businesses, they demonstrate why, contrary to conventional wisdom, nice people finish first.<br><br>Turning the well-known adage of &#x201c;Nice Guys Finish Last&#x201d; on its ear, <i>The Power of Nice</i> shows that &#x201c;nice&#x201d; companies have lower employee turnover, lower recruitment costs, and higher productivity. Nice people live longer, are healthier, and make more money. In today&#x2019;s interconnected world, companies and people with a reputation for cooperation and fair play forge the kind of relationships that lead to bigger and better opportunities, both in business and in life. <br><br>Kaplan Thaler and Koval illustrate the surprising power of nice with an array of real-life examples from the business arena as well as from their personal lives. Most important, they present a plan of action covering everything from creating a positive impression to sweetening the pot to turning enemies into allies. Filled with inspiration and suggestions on how to supercharge your career and expand your reach in the workplace, <i>The Power of Nice</i> will transform how you live and work.</p><p>LINDA KAPLAN THALER is the CEO and chief creative officer and ROBIN KOVAL is the president of the Kaplan Thaler Group. Ranked as the fastest growing advertising agency in the United States by leading industry publications, with over a billion dollars in billings, the agency has won thirteen Clio Awards. Kaplan Thaler and Koval are the coauthors of the national bestseller, <i>Bang! </i>They<i> </i>live in the New York metropolitan area.Chapter 1 <br>The Power of Nice <br><br>For years, we have loved a particular security guard in our Manhattan office building. In fact, most of us at The Kaplan Thaler Group think the world of him. A large, jovial man in his mid-fifties, Frank brightens people&#x2019;s days by giving everyone who walks into our building a huge, warm greeting. &#x201c;Hello, Linda!&#x201d; &#x201c;Hello, Robin!&#x201d; he&#x2019;ll say. &#x201c;Happy Friday!&#x201d; <br><br>Frank&#x2019;s engaging banter changed the way we started work in the morning. Instead of simply flashing our passes anonymously and making a beeline for the elevator, we found ourselves seeking out Frank and making sure to say hello. He set a positive tone for the entire day. But we never considered how Frank might be helping our business, other than preventing intruders from entering the premises. <br><br>That is, until the day Richard Davis, the president and COO of U.S. Bank, the sixth-largest bank in the United States, came to see us. For months, our entire team at The Kaplan Thaler Group had been working to create a pitch that would wow Davis and win us the huge U.S. Bank account. <br> <br>At the time of Davis&#x2019;s visit, it was down to the wire. We were one of two agencies still in the running for the account. Davis and his team were flying in from their executive offices in Minneapolis to meet personally with us. We didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time, but in fact Davis and his staff were a bit apprehensive about the kind of treatment they&#x2019;d get in New York City. The furious pace and hard-bitten &#x201c;out of my way&#x201d; attitude of the Big Apple had become part of the mythology of the city. They were afraid we would be too cold, too aloof. <br><br>But when Richard Davis and his team walked into our building, they received a warm, enthusiastic greeting from Frank. When Davis reached our offices a few minutes later, he was gushing about the friendly security guard. &#x201c;This guy gave me a huge hello!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And all of a sudden, I thought how could I <i>not</i> want to work with a company that has someone like Frank? How can I feel anything but good about hiring an agency like that?&#x201d; We won the account. <br><br>Of course, Davis wouldn&#x2019;t have awarded us the job if he wasn&#x2019;t impressed with our work. But we&#x2019;ve gotta give Frank credit. With a multimillion-dollar account in the balance, it was Frank&#x2019;s warm hello that helped us cinch the deal. <br><br>That is the power of nice.<br>The security guard wins the heart of the COO. It might sound like a Disney movie, but we can assure you it was no fantasy. We wrote <i>The Power of Nice</i> because we completely disagreed with the conventional wisdom that &#x201c;Nice guys finish last&#x201d; and &#x201c;No good deed goes unpunished.&#x201d; Our culture has helped to propagate the myth of social Darwinism&#x2013;of survival of the fittest&#x2013;that the cutthroat &#x201c;me vs. you&#x201d; philosophy wins the day. One of the biggest-selling career books in the past few years is called <i>Nice Girls Don&#x2019;t Get the Corner Office</i>. Yet this completely contradicts the way we have run our business and our lives. In less than a decade, we built The Kaplan Thaler Group into a powerhouse in advertising with close to $1 billion in billings, making it one of the nation&#x2019;s fastest-growing advertising agencies. Our success was won not with pitchforks and spears, but with flowers and chocolates. Our growth is the result not of fear and intimidation, but of smiles and compliments. <br> <br>Time and time again, we have seen the extraordinary power of nice in our business dealings and in our personal lives. It is the patient passenger who politely asks the airline ticket agent to please check one more time who gets the first-class upgrade, rather than the &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a triple platinum member&#x201d; blowhard. It is the driver who is polite and apologetic to the police officer who sometimes is forgiven for driving over the speed limit. <br><br>But nice has an image problem. Nice gets no respect. To be labeled &#x201c;nice&#x201d; usually means the other person has little else positive to say about you. To be nice is to be considered Pollyanna and passive, wimpy, and Milquetoast. Let us be clear: <i>Nice is not naive</i>. Nice does not mean smiling blandly while others walk all over you. Nice does not mean being a doormat. In fact, we would argue that <i>nice is the toughest four-letter word you&#x2019;ll ever hear</i>. It means moving forward with the clear-eyed confidence that comes from knowing that being very nice and placing other people&#x2019;s needs on the same level as your own will get you everything you want. Think about it: <br> <br><i>Nice is luckier in love</i>. People who are low-key and congenial have one-half the divorce rate of the general population, says a University of Toronto study.(1)<br> <br><i>Nice makes more money</i>. According to Professor Daniel Goleman, who conducted research on how emotions affect the workplace for his book <i>Primal Leadership</i>, there is a direct correlation between employee morale and the bottom line. One study found that every 2 percent increase in the service climate&#x2013;that is, the general cheerfulness and helpfulness of the staff&#x2013;saw a 1 percent increase in revenue.(2)<br> <br><i>Nice is healthier</i>. A University of Michigan study found that older Americans who provide support to others&#x2013; either through volunteer work or simply by being a good friend and neighbor&#x2013;had a 60 percent lower rate of premature death than their unhelpful peers. <br><br><i>Nice spends less time in court</i>. One study found that doctors who had never been sued spoke to their patients for an average of three minutes longer than physicians who had been sued twice or more, reports Malcolm Gladwell in his book <i>Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</i>. <br><br>It is often the small kindnesses&#x2013;the smiles, gestures, compliments, favors&#x2013;that make our day and can even change our lives. Whether you are leading your own company, running for president of the PTA, or just trying to conduct a civil conversation with your teenage daughter, the power of nice will help you break through the misconceptions that keep you from achieving your goals. The power of nice will help you to open doors, improve your relationships at work and at home, and let you sleep a whole lot better. Nice not only finishes first; those who use its nurturing power wind up happier, to boot! <br> <br>In the chapters ahead, we&#x2019;ll show you that being nice doesn&#x2019;t mean sacrificing what you want for someone else. There&#x2019;s always a second, third, or even fourth solution when you apply the principles of nice.<br>Chapter 2 <br>The Six Power of Nice Principles<br><br>The Power of Nice Principle #1<br><br><b>Positive impressions are like seeds. <br></b><br>Every time you smile at a messenger, laugh at a coworker&#x2019;s joke, thank an assistant, or treat a stranger with graciousness and respect, you throw off positive energy. That energy makes an impression on the other person that, in turn, is passed along to and imprinted on the myriad others he or she meets. Such imprints have a multiplier effect. And ultimately, those favorable impressions find their way back to you. That doesn&#x2019;t mean the waiter you tipped well will one day found a Fortune 100 company and offer you stock options (unless it was one hell of a tip). The results of the power of nice are rarely that direct. In fact, you may not notice any impact on your life for years, apart from the warm glow it gives you inside. Nonetheless, we have found that the power of nice has a domino effect. You may not ever be able to trace your good fortune back to a specific encounter, but it is a mathematical certainty that the power of nice lays the groundwork for many opportunities down the road. These positive impressions are like seeds. You plant them and forget about them, but underneath the surface, they&#x2019;re growing and expanding, often exponentially.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s an example of how the power of nice has worked for us. Not long ago, we featured Donald Trump&#x2019;s wife, Melania, in an Aflac commercial, at the suggestion of Aflac chairman and CEO Daniel Amos. We gave Mrs. Trump, as one of the stars of the commercial, her own trailer and made sure she was comfortable and had everything she needed. Our team treated her nicely not because she was married to a famous person, but because we have a policy of being polite and respectful to all the talent on our advertising shoots.<br><br>Months later, the producers of <i>The Apprentice</i> asked Linda to be a judge on one of the shows, in which the apprentice hopefuls were required to create a car advertisement:<br><br><i>Before the first segment was shot, I introduced myself to Donald Trump, mentioning that we were the agency that had used his wife in an Aflac duck commercial. Well, Trump clearly remembered his wife&#x2019;s experience, because right before the shooting started, he leaned over and said, &#x201c;You were so nice to my wife. Watch how I return the favor.&#x201d; <br><br>Then he got on and described The Kaplan Thaler Group as one of the hottest ad agencies in the country&#x2013;on network television! He then went out of his way to include me in the on-camera discussions. All because we were nice to his wife.<br><br></i><br>The Power of Nice Principle #2 <br> <br><b>You never know.<br></b><br>OK, you&#x2019;re thinking. So it pays to be nice to Donald Trump&#x2019;s wife. But we&#x2019;re all smart enough to cooperate with the important people in our lives&#x2013;the people we interact with often, like neighbors and coworkers, and the people involved in important transactions, such as mortgage brokers and prospective employers. We&#x2019;re much less likely, however, to worry about, say, a stranger whom we&#x2019;ll never see again. Too often, our thinking is &#x201c;What does it matter?&#x201d; <br><br>Diane Karnett certainly never thought the young woman she met on a train home to New York City would transform her life. The woman was visiting her grandmother, who happened to live in Diane&#x2019;s neighborhood, so they split a cab ride. When they arrived at the grandmother&#x2019;s apartment, the woman asked Diane if she&#x2019;d help her carry her bags up to the fifth-floor walk-up. <br><br>&#x201c;I figured why not?&#x201d; But by the time they reached the fourth floor, she could think of many reasons why not. <br><br>The woman&#x2019;s eighty-five-year-old grandmother turned out to be an ex-Ziegfeld showgirl named Millie Darling, who befriended Diane and showed her New York as she had never known it. &#x201c;Through the years, I was treated like royalty at her favorite jazz clubs and saloons,&#x201d; says Diane. <br><br>That would have been more than enough reward for lugging a few bags up several flights of stairs. But it turns out Millie was the mother of Chan Parker, widow of the legendary jazz great Charlie Parker. When Diane was unemployed, Chan invited Diane to live with her in her farmhouse outside of Paris. Diane accepted and told her former employer about her move. They said that since she was moving to Paris anyway, why not set up shop and run a co-venture for them there? Diane remained in Paris for four glorious years, spending weekends at Chan Parker&#x2019;s farmhouse, socializing with Chan&#x2019;s fabulous and fascinating visitors&#x2013;jazz legends, journalists, even Clint Eastwood. &#x201c;I could have let that stranger on the train carry her own bags up. And missed it all,&#x201d; says Diane.<br><br>When we meet strangers on the street, we usually assume they aren&#x2019;t important to us. Unlike our friend Diane, we often avoid contact with the woman sitting next to us on the train or maybe even race ahead to beat her to a cab as we exit the station. The thinking is, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just some woman who has nothing to do with my life. Getting the cab is more important than being nice to her.&#x201d; <br><br>But how do you know that? This woman could be the sister of your boss. Or a real estate agent who knows of a home in your dream neighborhood. Or the head of a foundation that could give your fledgling charity the backing it desperately needs. The bottom line is, this woman is important to many people. You have to treat everyone you meet as if they are the most important person in the world&#x2013; because they are.

At the moment, she continues to illustrate children's books, which is her favorite type of work.</p>Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Very simple biographies introduce famous women to young readers. Each selection highlights the accomplishments of its subject but does not go into detail. The lack of specificity, however, makes difficult topics more manageable for a child audience. In Maya Angelou, for example, the text says that Maya's mother's boyfriend "attacked her" and as a result Maya did not speak for five years. A significant event in Angelou's life is included but in an age-appropriate way. The illustration style for each book is different and seems chosen to suit the subject. In Maya Angelou, cartoon-style images appear strong and solid, reflecting Angelou's determination to overcome obstacles in her life. Amelia Earhart employs an airier, less representational art style that matches Earhart's sense of adventure and mystery. Observant readers will find small jokes, such as in a suburban scene in Earhart where most houses have a car parked alongside but one house has a rocket ship. Back matter includes photographs and a few more details about the topic person. The books are factual, without invented dialogue, but no sources are listed. Briticisms appear in Earhart, with terms such as learnt rather than learned. VERDICT These books serve as attractive overviews of the people profiled, but children will need further resources to get a full perspective of the subjects' lives.&#x2014;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</p><h2>Waiting for Wings (Rise and Shine)</h2><p>Every spring, butterflies emerge and dazzle the world with their vibrant beauty. But where do butterflies come from? How are they born? What do they eat--and how?<br> With a simple, rhyming text and glorious color-drenched collage, Lois Ehlert provides clear answers to these and other questions as she follows the life cycle of four common butterflies, from their beginnings as tiny hidden eggs and hungry caterpillars to their transformation into full-grown butterflies. Complete with butterfly and flower facts and identification tips, as well as a guide to planting a butterfly garden, this butterfly book is like no other.<br></p><p>Lois Ehlert, beloved illustrator of <i>Chicka Chicka Boom Boom</i> and many other bold, beautiful picture books has outdone herself with this gorgeous (seriously breathtaking) celebration of butterfly metamorphosis. "Out in the fields, eggs are hidden from view, / clinging to leaves with butterfly glue. / Soon caterpillars hatch. They creep and chew. / Each one knows what it must do." As the gentle rhyme unfolds, we turn the small, partial pages that form the larger spread of fabulous foliage in this lush, oversized book. Before our eyes, the eggs turn to caterpillars, the caterpillars to cases, the cases to lovely butterflies. "They pump their wings, get ready to fly, then hungry butterflies head for the sky." The colors become increasingly dazzling, each butterfly springing to life with Ehlert's color-soaked cut-paper magic. Several pages of background material conclude the book, labeling different kinds of butterflies at different stages of development, from the buckeye butterfly to the painted lady to the monarch. A "Butterfly Information" page clearly labels butterfly anatomy and answers basic question about these fascinating fluttery insects, a "Flower Identification" page showcases butterfly-attracting flowers such as the purple coneflower (echinacea), phlox, and lantana, and the last page offers a few pointers on growing a butterfly garden.

When storytime moves inside, Bunny is bereft. To satisfy his hunger for books, Bunny returns to the library at night and learns that although the library is locked, the book return slot is open.

It was there that I fell in love with pasta&#x2014;and where I <i>really</i> learned to make pasta.<br><br> The dominance of pasta in Bologna is evident within minutes of walking around the city. Just like taquerias inhabit every corner of the Mission in San Francisco, and the neon signs of pizza-by-the-slice joints light up Manhattan neighborhoods, so does fresh pasta rule the windows of Bologna markets. Sold by weight or by the bundle, fresh pasta is inescapable there. It comes in a rainbow of dough colors, and in all sizes, though you can be assured every shop proudly displays the requisite pasta signature of Bologna: nickel-sized tortellini. You might even see old ladies in the window, rolling out fresh pasta for tourist passersby.&nbsp;<br> But as someone once told me, Italy is &#x201c;under the table.&#x201d; In other words, to really, truly understand the essence of anything in Italy, you have to look a little harder, immerse yourself, and start to peel back the layers. Look past the Disneyland-like gloss of touristy restaurants in the city center with the overpriced microwaved tagliatelle Bolognese. Instead, seek out the under-the-radar olive grove in the countryside that has quietly been making oil in the same way for decades, or the hobbyist miller who taught himself how to produce the best flour in the area. Or see it in the the pair of young brothers at Zavoli Farms who are single-handedly maintaining tradition by raising indigenous heritage breed pigs in the easternmost, sun-kissed hills of Emilia-Romagna while pushing forward by experimenting with new techniques for making salumi.<br><br> As it happens, my &#x201c;under the table&#x201d; moment in Bologna actually took place above its streets. Having found myself in Italy looking for a change of pace from the fine dining kitchens of San Francisco, France, and Germany, I met a gregarious Bolognese native named Marcello via John Pauley, a chef I met while working at La Folie in San Francisco. Marcello had an available room in Bologna. Once he found out I was a cook looking to learn about Italian cuisine, he wasted no time in referring me to a place that would change the course of my career: Bruno e Franco la Salumeria.&nbsp;<br><br> The salumeria itself is glorious, its shelves stocked with jars of vibrant green olives, giant wheels of pungent cheese, and myriad cured pork products, all procured from the best in the region. Across the street is a little second-story room overlooking the salumeria. The street-level entrance is completely unmarked save for a hidden little buzzer. You wouldn&#x2019;t find it if you weren&#x2019;t looking for it; it cryptically reads &#x201c;<i>Laboratorio</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Up a narrow flight of stairs lies the salumeria&#x2019;s pasta &#x201c;laboratory&#x201d;&#x2014;a small workshop consisting of a few tables and little else. It&#x2019;s where all the fresh pasta sold in the salumeria is made. In old-school Bologna, the <i>laboratorio</i> and the salumeria have a symbiotic relationship; one exclusively makes the product and the other exclusively sells it. Compared to the splendor of the salumeria, the pasta lab room is incredibly bare bones, and despite the name, there&#x2019;s nothing scientific or laboratory-like about the place. It is more like a glimpse into the past.&nbsp;<br><br> Inside, there are a dozen Italian ladies of all ages dressed in pastel pink chef coats, making fresh pasta in the same way they did the day before, and the day before that, and the day before that. They only make a handful of pasta types: Bologna&#x2019;s sacred tortellini are the most prolific output of the room. Rounding out the day&#x2019;s work are batches of tagliatelle, passatelli, paglia e fieno (straw and hay), Roman-style gnocchi, and finally, depending on the day, maybe a few orders of ready-to-bake cannelloni. The entire day&#x2019;s production will sell out downstairs in the salumeria, and it will be restocked the next day.<br><br> Spanning several generations, the women themselves are the tableau of Bologna, and of Italy. Some of them come from an older generation, the generation that grew up in the war-ravaged years of the 1940s and 1950s, when food was scarce. They speak softly with an air of authority, often drifting off into dialect, basically acting like the Italian <i>nonna</i> you always imagined, telling winding anecdotes and politely answering your dumb question in that old, Italian matter-of-fact way that makes the question seem even dumber. Other ladies are younger. Some came from other careers; some have known nothing but pasta making. Some are natives of Bologna; some moved here from elsewhere in Italy. The ones from the south, for example, spark arguments about which region&#x2019;s cuisine is better. Whatever their origins, they all tell bawdy jokes, they gossip about town, they smoke in the bathroom during breaks. Many are mothers, since a job making pasta is amenable to family life. Their workday starts at dawn, allowing them to leave in time to pick up the children from school.&nbsp;<br> They are all wonderful and charismatic characters in a marvelous play.&nbsp;<br> Varying personalities aside, the women are all united through their work at the pasta <i>laboratorio</i>, where they work as a single, perfectly functioning unit. One rocks back and forth as she rolls out sheet after sheet of fresh handmade pasta dough with her <i>mattarello</i>, a long wooden Bolognese rolling pin. The women use <i>matarelli</i> made especially for the <i>laboratorio</i> by a blind woodworker down the block; mechanical pasta machines are frowned upon, to say the least. Another woman is mixing gnocchi dough by hand in the corner, while a third, working at the window, wields a weathered knife to precisely slice pasta dough into the uniform shreds of tagliatelle.&nbsp;<br> The rest of the ladies hover around a table near the entrance, methodically forming the day&#x2019;s worth of tortellini to be sold downstairs. While they twist the circular shapes, their constant chatter fills the room. The pasta lab is a time capsule&#x2014;a fully functioning preservation of Bolognese culture and tradition. <br><br> It is true craftsmanship.&nbsp;There are no assigned jobs, but each woman floats from one table to the next. Maybe the youngest one&#x2014;or the one who came to work late that day&#x2014;will get stuck making the cannelloni; forming the filled pasta is the messy, labor-intensive job that no one else wants to do. The voices of the ladies barely overshadow the rhythmic, dull sounds of the rolling pin slowly doing its dance, stretching the pasta dough over the wooden table, forming their <i>sfoglia</i>&#x2014;the sheet of fresh pasta dough. When the dough is completely flattened into a massive, imprecise four-foot-wide sheet, it is slid over to another table, where the tortellini are formed by other ladies.&nbsp;<br><br> Every hour or so, the teenage kid from the downstairs salumeria&nbsp;arrives to take a few trays of pasta down to the salumeria, looking at me and gently sighing how glad he is that he didn&#x2019;t<br> have to be the only guy upstairs in the lab anymore. He confesses, in his broken English, that he felt uncomfortable when the ladies would discuss, as he put it, &#x201c;feminine topics.&#x201d; He smiles and takes the trays of pasta downstairs to the display case.&nbsp;<br><br> I found myself in the pasta lab by chance, and I stayed for months. The ladies became family, though I&#x2019;m pretty sure they made fun of my Italian language skills (or lack thereof). After working as a fine dining soldier for years, I felt myself yearning for a change, for something more soulful, more personal. I found it in the unlikeliest of laboratories, along with a new pasta passion.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br>Eggplant Mezzalune with Cherry Tomatoes<br> Growing up in New Jersey, I was subjected to bastardized versions of Italian food throughout my childhood, much of which involved massive amounts of coagulated cheese and cloyingly sweet tomato sauce. One of the pillars of East Coast Italian-American cuisine is, of course, eggplant Parmesan&#x2014;fried slices of breaded eggplant, buried in an avalanche of <br> red sauce and melted cheese.<br><br> Many of our dishes at Flour + Water have roots in familiar flavor combinations, and this is my Northern California take on those eggplant Parmesan flavors&#x2014;tomatoes, eggplant, melted cheese&#x2014;with a key twist of smokiness from the treccione scamorza, a smoked mozzarella cheese. (If you can&#x2019;t find treccione scamorza, use another smoky soft cheese, like smoked mozzarella; in a pinch, any good mozzarella will suffice as well.)&nbsp;<br> Eggplant always lends itself beautifully to smoky flavors, and it&#x2019;s a common flavor pairing in southern Italy, where smoked soft cheeses are abundant. If you ask a southerner&#x2014;like Angela Moncada, one of the ladies in the pasta <i>laboratorio</i> whose family came from Sicily to Bologna&#x2014;about the best home-cooked southern dishes, <i>melanzane alla parmigiana</i> is invariably at the top of the list. What&#x2019;s <i>not</i> so common in southern Italy are stuffed pastas. But here, we incorporate those southern flavors in a stuffed pasta shape named mezzalune (half moons).&nbsp;<br> Mezzalune are probably the most basic stuffed pasta shape in this book&#x2014;just one fold of a circle&#x2014;and a great way to get your feet wet in the stuffed pasta realm.&nbsp;<br> Serves 4<br><br> <b>Equipment</b><br> Blender&nbsp; +&nbsp; Baking sheets&nbsp; +&nbsp; Pasta machine &nbsp; <br> Rolling pin&nbsp; +&nbsp; 2ï¿½-inch ring mold or cookie cutter &nbsp; <br> Piping bag (optional) +&nbsp; Spray bottle<br> <b>Store-bought option</b><br> Any fresh, cheese-stuffed pasta<br><br> <b>Eggplant Filling</b><br> 2 large globe eggplants, halved lengthwise (700 grams)&nbsp;<br> Olive oil<br> Kosher salt<br> ï¿½ cup treccione scamorza cheese, finely diced (131 grams)<br> ï¿½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese&nbsp;<br> Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br><br> <b>Tomato Sauce</b><br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil&nbsp;<br> 1 medium clove garlic, very thinly sliced<br> 1 cup cherry tomatoes, stemmed (150 grams)&nbsp;<br> Freshly squeezed lemon juice (optional)<br><br> <b>Mezzalune</b><br> 1 recipe Rav Dough (page 7)<br> 1ï¿½ tablespoons Aleppo pepper<br><br> <b>Marinated Cherry Tomatoes</b><br> 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (200 grams)<br> Sea salt<br> Cracked black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br><br> <b>To Finish</b><br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil&nbsp;<br> Kosher salt<br> 1ï¿½ cups loosely packed whole fresh basil leaves<br> Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for finishing<br><br> Preheat the oven to 325ï¿½F.&nbsp;<br> To make the filling, with a knife, score a shallow crosshatch pattern in the flesh of the eggplant to allow steam to penetrate while cooking. Lightly season the eggplant flesh with olive oil and a pinch of salt. Place the eggplant halves, face down, on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven until the flesh is soft and fully tender when pierced with a knife, about 25 minutes. Scoop out the flesh and add to the jar of a blender. Puree until smooth.&nbsp;<br><br> Quickly transfer the eggplant puree to a mixing bowl while still hot, and, with a wooden spoon, stir in the treccione scamorza and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Mix until the cheeses are melted and<br> well incorporated. Add the lemon zest and juice and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate the filling until ready to use. The filling can be refrigerated up to 3 days.<br><br> To make the sauce, add the olive oil and garlic to a cold sautï¿½ pan and cook over medium-high heat until the garlic starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the whole cherry tomatoes and cook until they start to blister and their skin just starts to break. Don&#x2019;t overcook&#x2014;you want a fresh tomato sauce, not a concentrate. Transfer the tomato mixture to the jar of a blender and puree until smooth. Season to taste; if your tomatoes aren&#x2019;t very acidic, add a squeeze of lemon juice. Set aside.<br><br> Dust 2 baking sheets with semolina flour and set aside.&nbsp;To make the pasta, follow the instructions for the Rav Dough (page 7), incorporating the Aleppo pepper with the dry ingredients.&nbsp;Using a pasta machine, roll out the dough until the sheet is <br> just translucent (see page 10). Cut a 2-foot section of the dough sheet and cover the rest of the dough with plastic wrap.<br><br> Using a 2ï¿½-inch-diameter ring mold or round cookie cutter, cut out rounds of dough.<br> Using a piping bag or a spoon, place a teaspoon of filling in the middle of a dough round, leaving ï¿½ inch of dough bare around the edge. Fold the circle in half to create a half-moon shape. Use a spritz of water from a spray bottle to help seal it if necessary. Start the seal at the top crest of the half-moon (12 o&#x2019;clock): gently but firmly seal the dough, removing the <br> air pocket by moving your fingers down the edges on both sides simultaneously, caressing the filling to create a tight, airless pillow.&nbsp;<br><br> Put the mezzalune on a flat surface and crimp the edges with a fork. Working quickly, place the mezzalune, slightly apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Don&#x2019;t let the mezzalune touch each other or they may stick together. Repeat until you run out of dough or filling. You should get about 45 to 50 pieces. Let them sit uncovered while you make the marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes should be made no more than 30 minutes before using them or they will start to break down.&nbsp;<br><br> To prepare the marinated tomatoes, season the tomatoes generously with salt, pepper, and the olive oil. Allow to marinate for 20 minutes before plating.&nbsp;<br><br> To finish, bring a large pot of seasoned water to a boil (see page 18). Add the 2 tablespoons olive oil and ï¿½ cup pasta water to a cold 12-inch sautï¿½ pan. Place the pan over high heat and bring to a simmer.<br><br> Drop the filled mezzalune in the large pot of boiling water.&nbsp;Once the pasta is cooked 80 percent through, until almost al dente, 2 to 3 minutes, transfer to the sautï¿½ pan using a hand-held strainer and stir to incorporate. Reserve the pasta water. Add the tomato sauce to the pan and season with salt. Bring the sauce back up to a simmer and cook until the sauce coats <br> the back of a spoon and the pasta is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.<br><br> To serve, divide the pasta and sauce between four plates. Garnish each serving with fresh basil, marinated cherry tomatoes, and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p><h2>The College Panda&#39;s ACT Math: Advanced Guide and Workbook</h2><p><p>This book brings together everything you need to know for the ACT math section.

He exercises a masterful precision over the language and pacing of his narrative, and in some 500 pages, there's rarely a word that feels out of place. The title is a reference to baseball, but Harbach's concern with sports is more than just a cheap metaphor. <i>The Art of Fielding</i> explores relationships--between friends, family, and lovers--and the unpredictable forces that complicate them. There's an unintended affair, a post-graduate plan derailed by rejection letters, a marriage dissolved by honesty, and at the center of the book, the single baseball error that sets all of these events into motion. <i>The Art of Fielding</i> is somehow both confident and intimate, simple yet deeply moving.

This time no rustle of wind, no birdcall, no sliver of light penetrated the thick canopy of trees. Silence thundered in my ears like a band of warhorses. And then, through the gloom, I heard my mother call my name, her voice soft and hollow-throated as a dove&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Languoreth.<br> <br>I woke with a start as my brother tugged back the covers and a rush of cold air met my feet. Lailoken&#x2019;s sandy hair was unkempt. He watched impatiently as I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and reached for my dress, but as I tugged the wool over my head, my mind quickened and the memory came rushing back.<br> <br>Mother was dead.<br> <br>Nine days had passed since the sickness took her. Sleep&#x2014;when it came&#x2014;brought some relief, but each morning when I woke, my wound tore open anew.<br> <br>&#x201c;I dreamt of her.&#x201d; I looked at my brother. &#x201c;Mother was calling my name, I&#x2019;m certain. If only I could have seen her . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I waited a moment, hoping for a response, but Lailoken only frowned and handed me my cloak. The purple rings beneath his eyes told me he&#x2019;d been up through the night again, seeking her spirit in the Summerlands. For a moment, Lail looked envious I&#x2019;d dreamt of her. But if my brother did not sleep, how could he dream?<br> <br>&#x201c;Tonight you must rest,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There is sickness yet beyond Cadzow&#x2019;s walls.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lail&#x2019;s face only darkened.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lailoken.&#x201d; I caught his sleeve. &#x201c;Sooner or later you will have to speak.&#x201d;<br> <br>He ignored me, reaching instead for the door&#x2019;s iron latch.<br> <br>&#x201c;You cannot force her to come to you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;After all, the Wisdom Keepers say&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Lail turned on his heel, his narrowed eyes unmistakable.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t be stupid&#x2014;you&#x2019;re going to wake Crowan.<br> <br>I bit my tongue. I didn&#x2019;t want to wake our nursemaid any more than he; Crowan would never allow us to go down to the river this time of morning. And though neither Lailoken nor I could explain it, we knew the beast waiting in the shallows waited for us alone. As though it were ours alone to see.<br> <br>I followed Lailoken down the dark corridor, softening my footfalls as we crept past the entryway to the great room with its sleeping warriors and softly dying embers.<br> <br>Yes, Mother was dead. Now our rambling timber hall felt like a husk without her.<br> <br>I swallowed the stinging that rose in my throat and followed Lailoken out the heavy oaken door and into the milky morning light.<br> <br>In the courtyard, mist swathed the late winter grasses. Past the fallow kitchen garden, Brant stood watch on the platform of the inner rampart, breath clouding beneath his hood. At the sound of our footsteps, his grip tightened on his spear before he caught sight of us and smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ho, there, little cousins. And where do you suppose you&#x2019;re off to?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re only going down to the river,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Brant looked at Lailoken. &#x201c;Still no good morning from you, eh, Lailoken?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t speaking to anyone.&#x201d; I shifted my weight, and Brant&#x2019;s brown eyes softened.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right, then. Down to the river.&#x201d; He gestured us through. &#x201c;But you two had better mind each other. The cliff trail is slick as a snake&#x2019;s belly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be careful,&#x201d; I swore, but as we hurried through the gate, I made certain Lailoken felt my eyes on the back of his head. It was hurtful and foolish, his vigil of silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you imagine you miss her more than I do?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You are not the only one who lost her, Lailoken. Mother&#x2019;s gone and we cannot bring her back.&#x201d;<br> <br>My brother stiffened as he ducked beneath a low-hanging bough, but at the sound of hurt in my voice he glanced back, reaching for my hand.<br> <br>An offering, an apology.<br> <br>I joined my fingers with his and we wound our way along the forest path to the place where the towering outer rampart ended. At the cliff&#x2019;s edge, a deer trail stretched down hundreds of feet to the gorge below. A thick sponge of moss lined the narrow trail where the first tender shoots of fern budded from their peaty winter beds. We edged down the steep path toward the river, mud caking the leather lacing of our boots, and I breathed in the earthy smell that always brought relief. My mother had spent endless days in the forest with us, plucking mushrooms from fallen tree trunks, gathering blackberries and marshmallow and nettle, using the knife she kept at her belt to strip the bark from hazel and birch. Mother was the wife of a king. But she had also been a Wisdom Keeper, trained in the art of healing. It was the lady Idell our tenants visited for a tonic to ease their child&#x2019;s cough, a salve to slather on their horse&#x2019;s foot, or a remedy to ease the aches of old age. And it was by her side, in the woods, under our great roof of trees, that I felt most at home.<br> <br>The river Avon glinted like liquid glass as we emerged at the cliff bottom. Stooping low, we moved softly through the underbrush until we neared the bank of the river and Lailoken squeezed my hand. We crouched at the water&#x2019;s edge, just out of sight, as I struggled to quiet my breathing.<br> <br>The red stag was magnificent&#x2014;nine points on each of his antlers. We watched the river course round his black hooves as he drank in the shallows, the graceful muscle working in his throat. It was strange to spot deer this late in winter, and stranger still to find one so close to our fort; most had been hunted into the deepest glades beyond Cadzow by now. Surely such a beast was wise to the ways of men. And yet, each morning since our mother&#x2019;s death, we had descended the steep banks of the gorge to find him standing in the current as if he, too, were keeping vigil.<br> <br>Now the only sound was the soft gurgle of water over rock. Fog pillowed over the dark sheen of river and I opened my ears to the sounds of the stream, longing to hear the sweet strains of the melody my mother so often hummed while walking the woods.<br> <br>Then, a movement flickered in the corner of my vision. I turned instinctually, looking upriver. At first I could make no sense of the shadowy form that appeared where nothing had stood a moment before. I blinked to clear my eyes. But there, in the water, rising out of the mist, stood a figure, her dark hair flowing over her simple green dress. If my fingers hadn&#x2019;t been stinging with cold, I would have been certain I was still dreaming.<br> <br>Mother.<br> <br>Her skin was no longer flushed by fever or marred by the blisters that had come. Her face was smooth and her lips wore a smile, but her gaze was unsettling; her eyes were wild and dark in the river&#x2019;s dim. I opened my mouth to cry out her name, but the stag bolted upright, nostrils flaring. I glanced back upriver, and my heart sank. My mother had vanished as quickly as she had come.<br> <br>Or had she been there at all?<br> <br>I balled my fists until my nails bit into the flesh of my palms. How could my eyes play such cruel tricks? There was nothing now but the soft wash of water. Only the great stag stood regarding us, his tawny pelt shimmering in the growing light of morning.<br> <br>Of course I hadn&#x2019;t seen her. We had scattered her ashes high in the hills. But next to me Lailoken let out a puff of breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was her, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I turned to him. &#x201c;You saw her, Lail, tell me! She was just there . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Lailoken gave a tight nod. Because he was my twin, I could feel his tears before they began. I sank down onto the pebbled bank. My brother sank down beside me. And together we poured our grief into the slowly waking world.<br> <br>We sat at the river&#x2019;s edge until our bodies grew stiff from cold and our sobs gave way to the sound of birds in the forest behind us. All the while the stag moved softly in the shallows. Perhaps tomorrow the beast would come no more&#x2014;after all, it had been nine days. Cathan the Wisdom Keeper said nine was the most magical of numbers.<br> <br>I was wiping my face with the corner of my cloak when Lail stiffened.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>He lifted a finger and gestured to the edge of the nearby thicket, where a brown hare was hunched beyond the brambles, its head tilted as if it were listening. Lail watched as it shivered its whiskers and scampered into the forest, his gaze following its trail. Then he turned to me, eyes rimmed red, and spoke the first words he&#x2019;d uttered in days.<br> <br>&#x201c;A rider is coming. He brings news from the east.&#x201d;<br> <br>A &#x201c;Knowing,&#x201d; or so the Wisdom Keepers called them. At night, and even in waking, Lail told me, he dreamt of such things: salmon circling the bottom of a forest pool, or the speckled eggs of a faraway falcon&#x2019;s nest. It had been Lail who had woken from sleep that first morning after Mother died and heeded the call to the river. There he&#x2019;d found the red stag standing in the shallows as if it were waiting. My brother had a gift for reading such signs from the Gods. We were only ten winters&#x2014;Lailoken was young to have such skill. Yet Lail could not make sense of why the great deer had come. Even so, I could sense now that my brother&#x2019;s gift was growing. Messengers came often to Cadzow with news for our father, but never before had Lailoken foreseen one.<br> <br>I shifted on the stones, straining to hear the sound of hoofbeats I knew were not yet approaching. A rider was coming&#x2014;it was only a matter of when&#x2014;and soon our nursemaid Crowan would wake to find our beds empty. I knew we should hurry, yet I could not take my eyes from the water.<br> <br>&#x201c;Was that truly Mother we saw?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Is that what it&#x2019;s like when you see someone from Spirit?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Lailoken squinted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen a spirit before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She looked just as real as anyone. Do you think if we stayed . . . we might see her again?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lail&#x2019;s blue eyes trailed to the water almost hopefully. But then he shook his head and wiped his nose on the back of his hand. I felt the small stab as he shut me out again and looked to the cliff top, where a yolky sun was filtering through the forest. The spell of dawn had broken. In the current, the stag shifted and meandered toward the opposite bank. I wanted to rest my head on his smooth flanks, make my mother reappear so she could chase away the emptiness. But we moved instead to climb the trail, turning our backs on the water.<br> <br>As we reached the little gully where our mother had so often sat by our side, I heard the echo of her voice rising up from the depths of my longing. She had called out my name in the darkness of my dream. But her voice had not been tender or full of love.<br> <br>Her voice had been full of warning.</p><h2>Snow (Caldecott Honor Book)</h2><p><p><b><i>Snow </i>is a 1998 <i>New York Times</i> Outstanding Book of the Year and a 1999 Caldecott Honor Book.</b><br><i></i><br><i>"It's snowing, said boy with dog.</i><br><i>"It's only a snowflake," said grandfather with beard.</i></p><p>No one thinks one or two snowflakes will amount to anything. Not the man with the hat or the lady with the umbrella. Not even the television or the radio forecasters. But one boy and his dog have faith that the snow will amount to something spectacular, and when flakes start to swirl down on the city, they are also the only ones who know how to truly enjoy it. </p><p>Uri Shulevitz' playful depiction of a snowy day and the transformation of a city is perfectly captured in simple, poetic text and lively watercolor and pen-and-ink illustrations.</p></p><p>Uri Shulevitz won a Caldecott Medal for his illustrated edition of Arthur Ransome's <i>The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship</i>, and has won numerous other awards for illustrating his own books. Not surprising, then, that he'd create such a lovely book as <i>Snow</i>, a touching story about childish hope, grumpy pessimistic grownups, and the wonder of snowfall. Will the snow come? (Oh, please?) In the first scene there is none, but the second has--if you can find it--a single flake. Then there are more--but they melt. And then, finally... joy! These are unusually subtle illustrations for a children's book: so many illustrators try to out-do each other with lurid effects and excessive brightness, but many of Shulevitz's exquisite panels are close to monotone. He paints whole cityscapes in a dozen shades of gray, with small human figures who you notice (at second glance) have coats of gray-green, gray-blue, or gray-brown. The adults have tiny Edwardian parasols or handle-bar moustaches. The abstract, atmospheric, folktale effect is heightened by a pared-to-the-bone text, just a few words per page. "'It's nothing,' said man with hat. Then three snowflakes. 'It's snowing,' said boy with dog." <i>Snow</i> perfectly captures the transformative nature of snow and the result is magical.

It had so many colors. I wanted to take the leaf out and play with it. But my arm was too short to reach the bottom of the water container. So I used a stick to try to take it out. It was difficult and I became impatient. I stirred and stirred twenty or thirty times, and yet the leaf didn&#x2019;t come to the surface. So I gave up and I threw away the stick. When I came back a few minutes later the leaf had come to the surface of the water, and I picked it up easily. In the few moments I had been away, the water had continued to swirl and had brought the leaf up to the surface.<br>This is how our unconscious mind works. When we have a problem or difficulty to solve or when we want to have more insight into a situation, our conscious mind has to entrust to the unconscious mind the task of finding the insight. The unconsciousness mind knows how to listen and collaborate with us and with our intentions. Sometimes before going to sleep you might tell your store consciousness: "Tomorrow I want to wake up at 4:30"; and tomorrow you will wake up at 4:30. To meditate you don&#x2019;t only use your conscious mind, what we call in Buddhism "mind consciousness"; you also need to know how to use and trust your unconscious mind, called "store consciousness" in Buddhism. When we plant a seed in the soil, we trust the soil. Mind consciousness should plant the object of meditation into the soil of store consciousness and not wrestle with it superficially on the level of mind consciousness.<br>When a peace conference takes place, it must be organized in that spirit. We have to rely on the collective insight offered by the collective store consciousness of all those who are in the conference. We should know the techniques of taking care of our collective store consciousness in order to have the greatest insight possible. If we can become more civilized, our legislature will operate like that. Every member will know how to practice so that store consciousness can offer the best insight.<br>During the day, mind consciousness creates all the conditions for store consciousness to be able to do it; it&#x2019;s by the practice of deep breathing, calming, looking deeply, and allowing ourselves to be, that we can help our store consciousness to offer the best. Not only psychotherapists, but also members of government should learn how to make good use of our unconscious mind to serve our people in our country and our world. We should all know how to practice to have more insight and to have the best kind of insight. When you offer this way to others, it needs to be based on your own experience of practice.<br><b> Kaleidoscope</b><br><br>When I was a child I used to enjoy playing with a kaleidoscope that I made from a tube and a few pieces of ground glass. Whenever I turned it a little bit, I saw many wonderful sights. Every time I made a small movement of my fingers, one sight would disappear and another would appear. I didn&#x2019;t cry at all when the first spectacle disappeared, because I knew that nothing was lost; another beautiful sight always followed.<br>When we look into a kaleidoscope, we see a beautiful symmetrical image; and whenever we turn the kaleidoscope, the image disappears. Can we describe this as a birth or a death? Or is the image only a manifestation? After this manifestation there&#x2019;s another manifestation that&#x2019;s equally beautiful&#x2014;nothing is lost at all. I have seen people die very peacefully, with a smile, because they see that birth and death are only waves on the surface of the ocean, just like the spectacle in the kaleidoscope.</p><h2>Kaffe Fassett&#39;s Quilts in Ireland: 20 designs for patchwork and quilting</h2><p><p><strong>World-renowned quilter Kaffe Fassett has done it again!</strong> Spectacular quilt designs and colorways created by Kaffe and his team of designers are showcased in<strong><em> Kaffe Fassett's Quilts in Ireland</em>.</strong> <strong>Kaffe's inspiration for the 20 eye-catching quilts in this book was the brilliant colors of western Ireland</strong>, with its rich greens of the rural landscape, the stunning colors of the individually painted cottages, and the rich interior of one of Ireland's handsome country houses.</p> <p><strong>Each of the quilts featured in <em>Kaffe Fassett's Quilts in Ireland</em> is made using new fabrics from the Kaffe Fassett Collective</strong> <strong>as well as Kaffe's favorites from his other fabric collections.

When Daniel the donkey tells them that there is a King coming into the city, the mice siblings are determined to find him despite being scoffed at by the animals that share their stable. Their journey through the streets, hotels, and the market is depicted in a way that loosely mirrors Mary and Joseph's search for lodging. Exhausted at the end of the day, they return home to find that their stable is THE stable, where the newborn baby Jesus exudes love for even the smallest of creatures. It's a sweet enough message, made more precious by the cartoon illustrations, though the story brings nothing new to the "Nativity through the eyes of the stable animals" genre.-Joanna Fabicon, Los Angeles Public Library &#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

And boy, is it irresistible. In the same way that kids can't read <i>Gallop!</i> without wanting to gallop around the room, <i>Waddle!</i>, an animals-in-motion Scanimation book, will inspire prancing, hopping, stomping, and scampering. And did we mention color? Created by the optical genius behind the phenomenal #1 and #2 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling children's books, <i>Gallop!</i> and <i>Swing!</i>, <i>Waddle!</i> adds touches of color to the images and integrates it into the text. That prancing pig is pink, the leaping dolphin is blue, the slithering snake yellow. The Scanimation itself is also more lifelike, as the author continues to refine his patented Scanimation process, resulting in a more fluid, realistic motion. Nothing else compares. <br><br><i>Waddle!</i> teaches color and movement. Its language is a joy, the rhymes inspiring, the animals full of life. And one more thing: Waddle! has a surprise ending.

Mr. Seder lives in Boston.<br>PreSchool-K&#x2014;Seder's "scanimation" books utilize his recognizable gimmick to varied effect. As readers turn each page, the animal in the stripy circle seems to prance, slither, hop, or flap. The text is predictably simple: "Can you waddle like a penguin?/slip-slide-swoop!/Can you hop like a frog?/flip-flop-floop!" The book culminates with, "If you can waddle,/stomp or hop,/...you'd better run! The alligator's/gonna/getcha!" Unfortunately, there is no logic in going from being able to move like all the animals to being attacked by the alligator. However, all issues aside, the moving animals and the encouragement of audience participation is sure to appeal to the intended audience, who probably won't care about the lackluster text. Ultimately, this is a one-trick pony.&#x2014;<i>Amy Lilien-Harper, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is devoted to several charities. He promotes literacy and education. He is a media darling.

He is focused on creatively inspiring youth to avoid poverty through education. He is the father of three children.We were getting close to the corner now. You know the spot. NBA players take tons of 3s from there because it's a shorter shot and a straight, squared-up look. And that means that we all practice from there all the time too, heaving it up and trying to do what they do. Even his dribbling changed a little. You know how it does that when someone's about to take a shot? It was going to be one jump shot from the corner. I didn't think I could get up and contest it with his length, and there was a good chance it would go in. But that's right where the big crack in the court was. It was the one I stumbled over last game. That's the whole reason I remembered it. Maybe if Carlos had tripped over it then, he would've remembered it too. But he hadn't, so he had to learn that lesson now. With his eyes already radar-locked, sizing up the rim, he had no idea it was coming. &#x201c;Look out, man,&#x201d; I heard Yeti yell behind me, but it was too late. The edge of Carlos's sneaker clipped the raised edge of the cracked black top. &#x201c;What the?&#x201d; he blurted. I didn't answer, just reached in and grabbed the ball as he tumbled sideways toward the fence. I turned fast, and for this weird moment, there were four sets of eyes staring right at me. Yeti and Ledge were facing forward, waiting to rebound in case Carlos had missed. And Tavoris and Deuce were facing me, wanting to be ready for whatever it was I was planning. Now they knew what it was. They stepped in front of their guys, and I had clear sailing to the hoop. One dribble, two dribbles, pull up, pop! If the rim still had any net left on it, it would've swished.</p><h2>The Cookie Collection: Artisan Baking for the Cookie Enthusiast (The Bake Feed)</h2><p><p><b>Introducing the ultimate ode to cookies, featuring over 100 cookie recipes every home baker should have in their collection.</b></p><p>Become a cookie connoisseur with a variety of flavors and cookie styles.

I have been elevated to higher and deeper levels of personal and professional growth by reading this book.&#x201d; &#x2014; Laela Erickson, Senior Business Development Executive Miyamoto Musashi (1584 &#x2013; 1645) was arguably the greatest swordsman who ever lived, a legendary figure whose methods of thought and strategy have been studied and adopted across a wide spectrum of society, from martial artists to military leaders to captains of industry. The iconic sword saint of Japan was clearly a genius, yet he was also a functional psychopath&#x2014;ruthless, fearless, hyper-focused, and utterly without conscience. Shortly before he died, Musashi wrote down his final thoughts about life for his favorite student Terao Magonojo to whom Go Rin No Sho, his famous Book of Five Rings, had also been dedicated. He called this treatise Dokkodo, which translates as "The Way of Walking Alone." The book you hold in your hands is the definitive interpretation of Musashi's final work. Readers are oftentimes subject to a single perspective about what some famous author from the past had to say, yet we are more holistic here. This treatise contains Musashi's original 21 precepts of the Dokkodo along with five different interpretations of each passage written from the viewpoints of a monk, a warrior, a teacher, an insurance executive, and a businessman. Each contributor has taken a divergent path from the others, yet shares the commonality of being a lifelong martial practitioner and published author. In this fashion you are not just reading a simple translation of Musashi's writing, you are scrutinizing his final words for deeper meaning. In them are enduring lessons for how to lead a successful and meaningful life.</p><p>Br. <b>Kris Wilder</b>, OSF is a member of The Order of St. Francis, one of many active Apostolic Christian Orders.

From providing milk and meat for sustenance and fiber and hides for clothing and shelter to carrying packs and clearing brush, there isn&#x2019;t much that goats cannot do. Managing goats successfully requires an understanding of how nature designed them to thrive, including nutritional and psychological needs, as well as how to identify a problem and intercede before it&#x2019;s too late.&nbsp;</p> <p>For more than a decade, Gianaclis Caldwell and her family have operated Pholia Farm Creamery, an off-grid, raw milk goat cheese dairy. In<em> Holistic Goat Care</em>, Caldwell offers readers a comprehensive guide to maintaining a healthy herd of goats, whether they are dairy goats, meat goats, fiber goats, or pet goats.</p> <p><em>Holistic Goat Care</em> will empower even novice goat owners to confidently diagnose and treat most of the ailments that goats might experience. For the experienced goat farmer, the book offers a depth of insight and approaches to treatment not found in any other book. Caldwell places special emphasis throughout on holistic, natural, and alternative approaches to caring for goats, including information on:</p> <ul> <li>&nbsp;Handling and managing goats using their natural instincts as an asset</li> <li>&nbsp;Developing good farm management practices such as appropriate housing and fencing systems and manure and mortality management</li> <li>Making feeding decisions based on understanding goats&#x2019; ruminant digestive system and their evolutionary needs</li> <li>Growing forage and garden crops as feed and utilizing wild browse</li> <li>Troubleshooting health problems based on assessing symptoms</li> <li>Implementing advanced health procedures such as pain control, fecal testing, and transplanting rumen microbes from healthy to sick goats</li> <li>Diagnosing, treating, and preventing more than 75 common goat ailments</li> </ul> <p>Whether your herd is two or two hundred, this first-of-its-kind, comprehensive book will help you keep your goats healthy, safe, and productive and give you a deep and enjoyable insight into the wondrous creature that is the goat.</p></p><p><p>Gianaclis Caldwell and her family operate Pholia Farm, an off-grid, raw milk cheese dairy in Oregon. She is the author of the award-winning <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em>, as well as other books on cheesemaking and running a dairy. Applying a holistic, organic management approach to the health of her goats comes naturally for Gianaclis: She was raised on an organic farm; her parents were chiropractors; and she pursued a career in nursing. Her aged, raw milk cheeses have been recognized and applauded by America&#x2019;s foremost authorities on cheese, and she travels nationwide to present workshops on cheesemaking and troubleshooting goat health problems.</p><p>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<em>Holistic Goat Care,</em>&nbsp;Gianaclis Caldwell demonstrates that modern, practical, holistic, small-farm methods are the true state of the art.

The book reflects both her hands-on experience with goats and her extensive knowledge of their physiological needs and their sometimes idiosyncratic behavior. The examples of goat farms in various climates and countries make the information broadly applicable to many regions.

As a firm believer in providing holistic and humane care for all my animals, I am pleased to finally find a book that covers this slant for goats.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2014;Molly Nolte, founder, Molly&#x2019;s Herbals and FiasCoFarm.com</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Holistic Goat Care</em>&nbsp;is an excellent resource for raising healthy goats. Gianaclis Caldwell stresses the importance of preventative medicine, which is a critical aspect of raising goats. The information in this well-written book will be very beneficial for beginners, agriculture-oriented students, veterinary students, and veterinarians. The author stresses the importance of early recognition of conditions and diseases. She also discusses treatment through conventional medicine and alternative or integrative medicine, as well as the use of complementary therapies such as herbal and homeopathic if needed. All sixteen chapters are very informative, and the text is referenced to excellent resources in goat medicine. I believe this book will be an excellent source of information in raising goats.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2014;Lionel J.

The introductory text by Katherine Dunn (author of <i>Geek Love</i>) helps give a context to the macabre scrapbook, and the handwritten captions display irony and sometimes humor; but this is no antiquarian's sentimental portrait of the past. This book documents butchery and brutality, horrible disease and mental illness, suicide and murder. And as Dunn observes, the eye of the beholder is not innocent: "The old cop, like the old con, tries to trick us into forgiveness and complicity. By witnessing he has participated, by understanding he is culpable. And his real purpose is to disguise the truth--that he started out terrified and ended up liking it, fascinated, an aficionado."</p><h2>Amelia Bedelia Chapter Book #8: Amelia Bedelia Dances Off</h2><p><p>In the eighth chapter book in the <em>New York Times</em>&#x2013;bestselling series, Amelia Bedelia puts on her dancing shoes and dances up a storm!

She is the mother of four children and lives in Edmonds, Washington.<b>Chapter Three: Gathering Ideas: A Suggestion Box for the Brain</b> <p>Once you start writing your goals down, the brain will send you all kinds of new material: innovative, energizing ideas for planning out and expanding those ambitions. That is the good news. Now for the bad: You will forget the best of the plans and ideas if you don't come up with a system for recording and reviewing them.</p> <p>Flash floods of insights come -- and go -- quickly.</p> <p>"The horror of that moment I shall never, never forget," says the king in <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> The queen's quick retort: "You will though, if you don't make a memorandum of it."</p> <p>I recommend that you purchase and carry with you a small memo pad to gather your ideas immediately as they come to you. In many large companies, wall boxes inviting comments foster creative contributions by employees. Similarly, this tiny notebook in your pocket will become a kind of suggestion box for your brain, inviting ideas by the fact that you carry it on your person.</p> <p>One example of a small memo book that helps get the job done is a wheel book.</p> <p>"You can't build a house without a wheel book," is the expression my close friend Nancy used when she was constructing a residence in Texas from the ground up. </p> <p>"Wheel book" is a nautical term. Nancy's husband Eric is a retired navy captain; at one point they lived aboard a forty-one-foot sailing ship. The navy uses a large thread-bound green memo book to chart the activity at the helm (in the wheelhouse), and smaller versions to track jobs to be done around the ship. Every conscientious individual on the ship carries one, from captain to chief to seaman. A wheel book assures accurate accounting.</p> <p>The first contractor Nancy was working with in Texas constantly promised things on which he did not follow through, frustrating Nancy immensely -- until she hit upon the solution: he needed a wheel book to write things down.</p> <p>When Nancy gave the contractor a wheel book, his performance improved immediately. Since then, the motto "You can't build a house without a wheel book" has become for me a catch phrase to embody the necessity of capturing on paper the strategies surrounding any big task I am working on. Whenever I have a goal in motion, a dream under construction, I carry a wheel book devoted exclusively to that project. In fact, I often emblazon Nancy's credo across the front of a small book as I christen it for a new adventure. "You can't build a house without a wheel book" applies to constructing more than new residences.</p> <p>Although a wheel book keeps track, in one convenient place, of the people to call and jobs to get done, it is infinitely more than that. </p> <p>Having a place to record your musings, and keeping it and a pen nearby, sends a signal to the brain, "I am ready for your input."</p> <p>Carrying a little book with you honors the ideas that come to you, and when you do that, the part of your brain that comes up with these suggestions will be so thrilled to get a little attention and respect that it will send you even more. You will become a hotbed of lively suggestions sparking your imagination continually.</p> <p><b>Tidbit Journals</b></p> <p>A tidbit journal is another kind of collection box for ideas. In <i>Put Your Heart on Paper,</i> I describe how Sara Rashad used a tidbit journal while traveling, as a place to jot down images and phrases she saw and heard during the day. Later, at night, she would transfer those tidbits to her larger format journal, expanding the narrative. Sara said that carrying this little book with her was not just for remembering details, but made her pay attention in a sharper way to what was happening all around her. She said it put her "in tune with every moment."</p> <p>When I gave a two-week workshop in Skyros, Greece, to an international audience, I brought with me from the States tiny books, replicas of old-time school composition books with marbleized covers. Across the front of each little book I wrote each student's name and the word "tidbits."</p> <p>I told them to take the book wherever they went and jot down concepts as they came to their mind, perhaps images they might want to write up more thoroughly later, or plans to put in motion once they returned to their own countries.</p> <p>By the second day, they told me warmly that having a place to record their impressions was keeping all their senses alert. It was helping them notice more, be more aware. It was encouraging them to think.</p> <p>I still chuckle when I remember how I'd see my students everywhere on the island, making "tidbit" entries -- on the beach, at the taverna, at the folk museum. One night we all went dancing at a nightclub on the edge of the Aegean called Skyropoula. There was Briano, a member of the class, in the midst of all the merriment, sitting in a corner with a glass of retsina, as eager as a cub reporter, capturing his fleeting thoughts on paper. What a happy look he had on his face.</p> <p>By the end of our two-week session together, they knew this wasn't just something to do for a summer course, but for the rest of their lives. They were astonished at how carrying those little books in their pockets had changed their entire experience of being in Greece. </p> <p>"I found myself," said Nonnie from Surrey, with delight, "as living twice as much as I did before, because I was paying attention more."</p> <p>That's because carrying a tidbit journal makes you keener to the workings of the RAS (reticular activating system) we talked about in chapter 1. Having a wheel book or a tidbit book ready at hand stimulates your thalamus to alert the cortex: Wake up. Open your eyes. Look and see. Be present to the signs all around you. Life is on your side.</p> <p>And keeping track of these signs by noting them makes them mount up.</p> <p><b>Changing the Conversation</b></p> <p>The "suggestion box for the brain" does not have to be a spiral or a sewn, bound book. It is just as effective -- for some, more so -- when the "ahas" you experience are captured and corralled on loose index cards.</p> <p>During a recent business trip to Manhattan, I had the opportunity to visit with John Sexton, the energetic and charismatic dean of New York University Law School, and my former high school debate coach.</p> <p>I had read an article about John Sexton in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> that mentioned his peripatetic habit of noting on the go, and was curious to learn more about it. He was happy to tell me about the "Sextonian suggestion box," which is both portable and potent.</p> <p>The dean carries a stack of unlined, white, jumbo index cards in his breast pocket. He pulls out one card at a time to make a note as something occurs to him, recording only one comment per card, with the card held vertically.</p> <p>Once he has written something down in black ink on the white card, he is free to move on to other considerations. It is, as he himself likes to say, "a done deal."</p> <p>He writes on the cards anything that he doesn't want to forget, either personal or professional.</p> <p>"If I am not thinking about family, I am thinking about school; something will come into my memory bank. Or maybe I'm trolling to see if there is anything that I ought to be doing, or I ought to have done, at home, or to set something up at school."</p> <p>Before it escapes him, he jots it down.</p> <p>The dean says he gets his ideas while walking through Washington Square Park, or when he's in a car going to an appointment. Sometimes an idea hits him in the middle of the night, or while shaving.</p> <p>"It might be a thought about a major new direction for the school; something unusual, an inspiration."</p> <p>Wherever he is, a card is nearby. He grabs one and writes down the elusive thought.</p> <p>"Or perhaps, an idea is developing, and in conversation I'll get a 'cut' on it I hadn't thought of before. Sometimes those ideas survive discussions with a colleague, and sometimes they don't, so what I will do then is write the idea on a card to make sure it survives."</p> <p>Sexton throws out the cards that have to do with appointments, or "if it's just an information thing"; others he gives to the appropriate faculty member or keeps on file until the job is done.</p> <p>For John Sexton, however, his system of index cards is dramatically more important than a running "to-do" list, easily dispersed and delegated.</p> <p>They are integral to his whole style of leadership. The dean has profound philosophical reflections on the part they play in his vision of community leadership at a great university and the whole notion of a leader. He calls it his "aspirational mode."</p> <p>"We have always understood culturally at some level the power of the word and the role of a leader to see things better than they are. Making it concrete actuates it. If you articulate something that is within the community's reach but not yet actuated, the articulation of the goal can move the community toward that actuation. And the same is true of yourself. If you articulate a need, an opportunity, or a concept, you'll start your mind going through the various stages.</p> <p>"It's not a question of getting the opportunities," he says with emphasis, "it's a question of noticing that opportunities are there."</p> <p>Leadership depends on spelling out for others the opportunities that are there, and on asking the questions. The job of the leader, he says, is to force the community to ask the right questions.</p> <p>"You are never going to get answers or creativity if you don't ask the questions."</p> <p>Sexton is emphatic about this.</p> <p>"I would put it this way: another way of looking at the cards is that they create an agenda of questions that I am asking. I am not going to get answers unless I am asking the questions, and unless I am putting myself under the burden constantly to want to know why, or how.</p> <p>"The cards force me to constantly be in a different kind of conversation with the community of people here." </p> <p>That conversation is action-oriented, leading him continually to ask the questions that challenge, that push toward the possible.</p> <p><b>Collecting Compliments: You Can Bank on It</b></p> <p>As anyone knows who has ever had a collection, from bottle caps or baseball cards to rare coins or stamps, things seem to multiply when you have a place ...</p></p><h2>The Magic Fish</h2><p>A greedy fisherman&#39;s wife is granted every wish but can&#39;t find happiness</p><p>An easy-to-read folktale for children 5-8 about a fish.</p><h2>Bleach SOULs.

Weaving together the different personal stories of the kids, their teacher, and the community that surrounds them, award-winning author Shelley Pearsall has written a vividly engaging story about the math, life and good-tasting barbecue. Filled with unexpected humor, poignant characters and quiet brilliance, All of the Above is a surprising gem.</p><p>A former teacher and museum historian, Shelley Pearsall is now a full-time writer. Her first novel, <i>Trouble Don't Last</i>, won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction. She lives in Akron, Ohio.Grade 5-8&#x2013;Exhausted by his efforts to teach math to apathetic middle schoolers, Mr. Collins proposes that his class attempt to build the worlds largest tetrahedron structure. The resulting endeavor, described in alternating chapters by Mr. Collins and four of the students, builds more than geometry as readers come to see them as individuals and as a developing unit. They include artistic tough guy James Harris III, who insists that the individual tetrahedrons color coordinate; Marcel the Magnificent, who works vigorously at his fathers barbecue grill; veteran foster child Sharice; and quietly ambitious Rhondell. Marcels dads recipes are sprinkled throughout. This novel is based on the true story of a Cleveland middle school tetrahedron built in 2002. Pearsall has a knack for creating strong narratives and characters that eschew predictability. While this solid, multivoiced offering is a hopeful one, the action is realistically gritty and true to its inner-city setting. The book may take a little hand-selling, but, like E. L.

They even have a word for this kind of coziness that comes with spending quality time in hearth and home when the days are short: "hygge". Trine Hahnemann is the doyenne of Scandinavian cooking, and loves nothing more than spending time in her kitchen cooking up comforting food in good company. This is her collection of recipes that will warm you up and teach you to embrace the art of hygge, no matter where you live.</p><p>A chef and food writer, Trine Hahnemann is an enthusiastic advocate for sustainable solutions, organic sourcing, and food cooked with love. With her great knowledge of Danish food and food culture, she writes for and appears regularly in the media in America and Britian. Trine has written ten cookbooks in her native Danish and four in English: <em>Scandinavian Baking</em>, <em>The Scandinavian Cookbook</em>, <em>Scandinavian Christmas</em>, and <em>The Nordic Diet/em&gt;.</em>"Trine Hahnemann's latest book attempts to translate hygge into the kitchen through 130 or so recipes for Scandinavian comfort food. . . There are sections on holiday food (a yule log), requisite recipes for rye bread, kringle, Danishes and even marzipan-filled Easter eggs. The photography (by Columbus Leth) is lovely, which helps the whole hygge thing quite a bit too. In other words, it's a very cozy book, with very cozy recipes. Hygge achieved." - Amy Scattergood, The Los Angeles Times<br><br>"What makes Hahnemann's book unique is that while hygge might be a trend, there's nothing about her recipes that are scream "food trend." This is a woman who believes in cooking good, whole foods, and serving it to the ones she loves. Just flipping through the pages, you get a feel for the Scandinavian seasons, of the light meals that are made for enjoying long summer nights and the heartier winter dishes that will always be accompanied by flickering candles. This book is perfect for anyone looking to incorporate not only more Scandinavian food into their diet, but healthier, wholesome recipes that make you feel good." - Anna Brones, Paste Magazine</p><h2>Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals</h2><p><b>Growth is good</b>. Through history, economic growth, in particular, has alleviated human misery, improved human happiness and opportunity, and lengthened human lives. Wealthier societies are more stable, offer better living standards, produce better medicines, and ensure greater autonomy, greater fulfillment, and more sources of fun. If we want to continue on our trends of growth, and the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for societies that come with it, every individual must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us. So, how do we proceed? <br><br> Tyler Cowen, in a culmination of 20 years of thinking and research, provides a roadmap for moving forward. In this new book, <i>Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals</i>, Cowen argues that our reason and common sense can help free us of the faulty ideas that hold us back as people and as a society. Stubborn Attachments, at its heart, makes the contemporary moral case for economic growth and delivers a great dose of inspiration and optimism about our future possibilities.<br> "Tyler Cowen is one of the most intriguing and eclectic thinkers on the planet like many people, I read something by him every day. In Stubborn Attachments he combines economics and philosophy in a truly important achievement. His best, most ambitious and most personal work. -Tim Harford, author of <i>The Undercover Economist</i><br> <i>As a means of practicing the altruism that Stubborn Attachments argues for, Tyler Cowen is donating all earnings from this book to a man he met in Ethiopia earlier this year with aspirations to open his own travel business.</i></p><p>Tyler Cowen is a Holbert L. Harris Professor of Economics at George Mason University and Director of the Mercatus Center. He received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1987. His book <i>The Great Stagnation: How America Ate the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better</i> was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. He was recently named in an <i>Economist</i> poll as one of the most influential economists of the last decade and several years ago <i>Bloomberg Businessweek</i> dubbed him "America's Hottest Economist." <i>Foreign Policy</i> magazine named him as one of its "Top 100 Global Thinkers" of 2011. He also cowrites a blog called Marginal Revolution, runs a podcast series called Conversations with Tyler, and has cofounded an online economics education project at MRUniversity. His last book was <i>The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream</i>.Is it possible to develop a sociopolitical philosophy that is believable, robust to human error and biases, and sensitive to the tradeoffs demanded by competing values? Tyler Cowen sets himself nothing short of this very task in <i>Stubborn Attachments</i>. Most of Tyler s books will change how you see the world in myriad of small ways. <i>Stubborn Attachments </i> might well change how you see the world in one very big way. Integrating ideas from across the social sciences, Tyler argues that we should regard the livelihoods of our future descendants including those distant descendants we ll never get to meet as highly as we regard our own. Our political choices should reflect this basic intertemporal egalitarianism. And economic growth, with its magnificent compounding benefits, thus deserves greater consideration as a high moral virtue. Whether you agree or disagree, I think you ll find that following the logic in <i>Stubborn Attachments</i> is as fun as it is intellectually provocative. --Cardiff Garcia, cohost of the NPR podcast, The Indicator from Planet Money<br><br>"Tyler Cowen is a national treasure, and Stubborn Attachments is brimming with deep insights about the immense importance of economic growth, moral obligations, rights, and how to think about the future. It's a book for right now, and a book for all times. A magnificent achievement." --Cass R. Sunstein, Robert Walmsley University Professor, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Cost-Benefit Revolution</i><br><br>"<i>Stubborn Attachments</i> is a deeply honest accounting of what matters, and the process by which we can determine what matters. Assumptions are laid bare from the outset, counter-claims are provided. The book invites you to fight it." --Mason Hartman</p><h2>Botanical Inspirations Deck &amp; Book Set</h2><p>In Victorian England, and in other cultures, flowers were used to convey specific meanings and messages, especially in the coy rituals of courtship.

As a young man he went to Paris, where he began painting the flowers of the royal gardens. His detailed etchings caught the attention of botanists who taught him more about the anatomy of plants and artists who introduced him to a new watercolor technique for illustrating flowers. Marie Antoinette hired Redoutï¿½ to decorate the walls of her chï¿½teau. By the late 1790s Redoutï¿½ had become the most famous and sought after flower painter in Europe. Empress Josephine invited him to come to Chï¿½teau de Malmaison to paint the flowers in her magnificent garden, which held over 200 varieties of roses. Between 1817 and 1824 Redoutï¿½ published a three-volume collection of his rose paintings called Les Rose, his most famous publication. Since roses were Redoutï¿½ s trademark, we have included four of his rose paintings in this Botanical Inspirations deck.</p><h2>Sorry Not Sorry: Dreams, Mistakes, and Growing Up</h2><p><b>Funny and deeply personal, <i>Sorry Not Sorry</i> recounts<i> Glee</i> star Naya Rivera's successes and missteps, urging young women to pursue their dreams and to refuse to let past mistakes define them.</b><br><br>Navigating through youth and young adulthood isn't easy, and in <i>Sorry Not Sorry</i>, Naya Rivera shows us that we're not alone in the highs, lows, and in-betweens. Whether it's with love and dating, career and ambition, friends, or gossip, Naya inspires us to follow our own destiny and step over--or plod through--all the crap along the way. After her rise and fall from early childhood stardom, barely eking her way through high school, a brief stint as a Hooters waitress, going through thick and thin with her mom/manager, and resurrecting her acting career as Santana Lopez on <i>Glee</i>, Naya emerged from these experiences with some key life lessons:<br><br>Sorry:<br>-&nbsp; All those times I scrawled "I HATE MY MOM" in my journal. So many moms and teenage daughters don't get along--we just have to realize it's nothing personal on either side.<br>-&nbsp; At-home highlights and DIY hair extensions. Some things are best left to the experts, and hair dye is one of them.<br>-&nbsp; Falling in love with the idea of a person, instead of the actual person.<br><br>Not Sorry:<br>-&nbsp; That I don't always get along with everyone. Having people not like you is a risk you have to take to be real, and I'll take that over being fake any day.<br>-&nbsp; Laughing at the gossip instead of getting upset by it.<br>-&nbsp; Getting my financial disasters out of the way early--before I was married or had a family--so that the only credit score that I wrecked was my own.<br><br>Even with a successful career and a family that she loves more than anything else, Naya says, "There's still a thirteen-year-old girl inside of me making detailed lists of how I can improve, who's never sure of my own self-worth." <i>Sorry Not Sorry</i> is for that thirteen-year-old in all of us.</p><p><b>Naya Rivera</b> is an actress and singer from Valencia, California. For six seasons, she played Santana Lopez on the hit show <i>Glee</i>. As a child, she appeared on <i>Family Matters</i>, <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>, and <i>The Royal Family</i>. She now lives with her husband, son, and two dogs in Los Angeles.<b>DON&#x2019;T STOP BELIEVIN&#x2019; </b><br><b> The <i>Glee </i>Years </b><br> &nbsp;<br> WHEN I AUDITIONED for <i>Glee</i>, I was anï¿½noyed. This wasn&#x2019;t super surprising, because at this point in my career, I hated auditions (still do, actually), but this one also involved driving out to a music store in Van Nuys to buy sheet music. Annoying errand aside, it did seem like one of the cooler auï¿½ditions I&#x2019;d been to in a long time because it involved singing. If I booked the role, it would be really awesome to be able to combine the two things I loved the most, but that was a big &#x201c;if.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d gotten really familiar with &#x201c;if&#x201d; over the last few years and wasn&#x2019;t counting on anything anymore. In fact, I so wasn&#x2019;t counting on it that I stood outside, smoking a cigaï¿½rette, right until it was time for me to go in and belt out Destiny&#x2019;s Child&#x2019;s &#x201c;Emotion&#x201d; (my choice) with all the runs included.<br> &nbsp;<br> The character I was auditioning for&#x2014;who would turn out to be the unforgettable Miss Santana Lopez&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t have any lines in the pilot, so I auditioned by reading Mercedes&#x2019;s lines. It was a whole bit about how hard it was to get stank ass out of polyester, and I made sure to add extra panache. <br> &nbsp;<br> Even after I booked it, I still wasn&#x2019;t that excited&#x2014;it was just a small role, and in a pilot episode. There was no telling if the show would be picked up or if I would be asked back if it was. When I showed up for the first day of filming, I walked into the production office and noticed that there were <i>Nip/Tuck </i>posters hanging everywhere. I was a huge fan of the show, and during one of my stints of unemployï¿½ment, my mom and I had watched every episode together. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why are there <i>Nip/Tuck </i>posters everywhere?&#x201d; I asked the kinda cute guy (who I would later make out with) beï¿½hind the desk. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is Ryan Murphy&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; he said snidely. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Ryan Murphy?&#x201d; I was clearly winning him over. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The creator of <i>Nip/Tuck</i>. This is <i>his </i>show.&#x201d; I sucked in my breath, and ran outside to call my mom. Now, in spite of my best efforts to remain cool and not get too attached to the show, I had to admit that I was more than just kind of excited. <br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s crazy now to look back and think about how much time we had to rehearse in the early days, when a lot of the cast was just getting used to doing choreographed numbers. We&#x2019;d work on one song for an entire week, whereas by the final season of the show, we&#x2019;d run through it just a few times and then be ready to roll. Since Santana wasn&#x2019;t part of the&nbsp;glee club in the beginning, she wasn&#x2019;t in the iconic opening number&#x2014;a rendition of Journey&#x2019;s &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Stop Believin&#x2019;&#x201d; that blows their teacher, Mr. Schuester, away. The actors who were a part of that number had already been rehearsing together for a while.<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember watching them as an outsider (much like my character would later in the show), and being kind of jealous of the bond they&#x2019;d clearly already formed&#x2014;they had all these inside jokes, like about how Cory couldn&#x2019;t dance. My feeling like an outsider changed quickly, though, when I met Dianna Agron, who played my fellow cheerleader, Quinn, and who also hadn&#x2019;t met anyone else yet. Dianna and I had all our scenes together, and we were instant friends. The trailers on set during the pilot were super small and divided in two. Dianna and I shared one, and we soon decided to take down the partition that separated it so we could make a bigger shared space.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried to think of ways I could make Santana stand out, even though she didn&#x2019;t have any lines. I figured that if she was the bitchy sidekick, then I was going to make her a megabitch with extra kick. There was a big scene in the choir room, with a bunch of students sitting in chairs, and I was rolling my eyes and popping my neck at every joke. And I guess it must have worked! Ryan Murphy shot the pilot, and between scenes one day, Dianna and I were walking in our Cheerios uniforms when Ryan came up to us and said, &#x201c;You should learn &#x2018;I Say a Little Prayer.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A song. You might be singing it in the next episode.&#x201d; Then he walked off. <br> &nbsp;<br> Dianna and I turned to each other, eyes open wide, but tried to play it cool. Next episode? That meant I was coming back! And not only did I have lines, but also an actual song! <br> &nbsp;<br> At first the show used two real high schools, one in Long Beach and one in Burbank, as stand-ins for McKinley High, so showing up to shoot felt like actually going back to school, with the football fields and linoleum-tiled hallways lined with rows of lockers. When wardrobe first handed me the cheerleading uniform, I was stoked. One, because I&#x2019;d never played a cheerleader before, and two, because I was relieved that I got to wear a costume that made me look hot. I reï¿½member trying it on and doing a little jump when I looked in the mirror. I had no idea that I&#x2019;d be wearing that same damn uniform for pretty much three years straight! My first scenes were all classic mean-girl shit, making fun of Rachel. My first line was a snide, tossed-off &#x201c;get a room&#x201d; as I walked by Will and Emma talking in the hallway. <br> &nbsp;<br> Then the rest is bitchy history. <br> &nbsp;<br> From the very beginning, we all knew that there was something special about <i>Glee</i>. For one, there weren&#x2019;t any huge names attached to it. It wasn&#x2019;t a show that just banked on an established star&#x2019;s personality, and that meant people who watched it got to know the characters first and the actors second. I think that&#x2019;s why <i>Glee </i>resonated with so many people. The show&#x2019;s acceptance of all types of characters who lived all types of lifestyles made kids in real life feel more accepted. For a lot of people, I think <i>Glee </i>was the first show that made it possible for them to turn on the TV and see someone who looked like them or who was dealing with the same kinds of issues they were dealing with. Plus, we weren&#x2019;t just a bunch of actors playing a band of misfits on TV&#x2014;we really were a band of misfits. And we were inseparable.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>LIVIN&#x2019; LA VIDA LOPEZ</b><br> &nbsp;<br> We were all super young when we started&#x2014;like twenty-one or twenty-two, and baby Chris Colfer was only nineteen&#x2014;and for all practical purposes, we were still kids. Going to work was like going to school, except we got paid to be there, and there were real consequences if we skipped. Oh, and I had people to talk to, rather than spending every free moï¿½ment on the phone with my mom so I looked popular.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our call times were often brutally early in the morning, and everyone quickly fell into the routine. Some people would be in a horrible mood because it was so early, and others would be disturbingly cheerful. As soon as we hit hair and makeup, we&#x2019;d start talking to one another, and no one would shut up for the rest of the day. Actors tend to be exï¿½troverts, and at least twenty times a day someone would do something that would have me laughing so hard that I&#x2019;d be red in the face and unable to catch my breath. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kevin McHale would always make weird faces. He did this one character he called Phil, where he&#x2019;d contort his face until he looked weird and creepy. In the middle of scenes, Kevin would have his back to you, but then he&#x2019;d turn around and there was Phil. Every time he did it, I thought Jenna Ushkowitz would pee her pants she laughed so hard. I also have video of Mark Salling skipping across the choir room, clapping his hands, and chanting, &#x201c;Eat your veggies, kids! What makes you different makes you special!&#x201d; because he thought our show had the morals of an after-school special. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Glee </i>was quick and colorful, and shot in a way that was snappy and in-your-face. Everyone loves teen drama, and <i>Glee </i>pulled it off with a twist. All the characters had surprisï¿½ing sides to them, and the dialogue was laced with witty one-liners and double entendres. In what other show would I get to play an underage cheerleader who tells John Stamos, playing a dentist, &#x201c;You can drill me any time&#x201d;? <br> &nbsp;<br> When the show first started, we&#x2019;d have an entire week to rehearse dance numbers and get the choreography down. We&#x2019;d rehearse at this dance studio on the Paramount lot called the Tin Shed, and a shed was just what it was&#x2014;the AC once broke and we still had to spend two days dancing in that sweat box, rehearsing for an episode with Kristin Chenoweth. Lea Michele kept threatening to call SAG about the unsafe working conditions. For once, Lea and I were in total agreement. Zach, our choreographer, has video of me where I turn around and stare straight into the camera with sweat dripping down my face. &#x201c;I hate this dannnnccccceeeee . . . ,&#x201d; I growl.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even a dance, Naya,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just eight counts!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Heather Morris and Harry Shum were the best dancers by far, since they were professionals, but it was hard to pick who was the worst&#x2014;because there were so many of us who were just really, really bad. Cory would get super frustrated, and I remember one year when we were rehearsing &#x201c;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&#x201d; for a sectionals perforï¿½mance, he huffed and puffed his way through it and kept threatening to throw up. Luckily for him, he was often the lead, so eventually they&#x2019;d just let him stand there and sing while everyone else danced around him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kevin was a pretty amazing dancer, even in a wheelchair&#x2014;go figure. Chris Colfer was good at picking up choreography but didn&#x2019;t have the best rhythm, so he eventually convinced the choreographers to let him use props, like brandishing a sword or swinging from the rafters in a cat suit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Singing and performing in <i>Glee </i>was exhilarating and exï¿½hausting, especially for me, because I still get stage fright. Being on stage was usually fine, but performing in the choir room was actually far more nerve-racking. It&#x2019;s 6:00 a.m., you&#x2019;ve only been awake for an hour, and you&#x2019;re the first perï¿½son up. Some people are still scarfing down eggs, or sleeping while sitting up, and you&#x2019;re there to belt out a really emoï¿½tional song. And I knew that they were all secretly judging because&#x2014;duh&#x2014;that was exactly what I did too.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first major song I got to perform was a duet of &#x201c;The Boy Is Mine&#x201d; with Amber Riley, and the whole thing stemmed from a joke. Ryan Murphy was a big fan of my Monica impression&#x2014;I&#x2019;d sing the song with all the warbling sass that she had, and Ryan was always randomly walking on set and requesting that I do it. <br> &nbsp;<br> I made him laugh enough that he finally wrote it into the script. &#x201c;Do you want me to sing it like me or sing it like Monica?&#x201d; I asked, and we settled on half and half. It&#x2019;s still one of my favorite numbers. Long live nineties R&amp;B. <br> &nbsp;<br> On-screen, Santana bedded Brittany, Finn, Puck, and Quinn (though the cameras only showed them cuddling postcoitally). In the Madonna episode, Santana took Finn&#x2019;s virginity to &#x201c;Like a Virgin,&#x201d; and seduction to a song was about as awkward as one might imagine. Cory and I didn&#x2019;t know each other that well at that point, but I had to crawl up his leg and pull his shirt and throw him on the bed and start grinding. He was supposed to chase me around the bed and pick me up and spin me, but I think he was a little hot-and-bothered/nervous about the whole thing, because evï¿½erything was a little off. Instead of a slow spin, he picked me up awkwardly and turned around so fast that I practically got whiplash. &#x201c;Oh, okay . . . ,&#x201d; Zach would say. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try that again . . .&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> But by far the worst scene I ever filmed was when Santana had to kiss the kid who had mono. One: we were shooting first thing in the morning. Two: they kept spritzing him with glycerin so he&#x2019;d look extra icky and sweaty. Three: actual, real DNA-containing spit kept transferring from his lip to mine on every single take, and I swear he was doing it on purpose.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the beginning, Santana and Brittany, Heather&#x2019;s charï¿½acter, were just allowed quick pecks, because the writers had to assure the network that they were just dipping their toes in the gay pool. But as their relationship progressed, hookup scenes with Heather could also be pretty uncomï¿½fortable (though she never spit on me), especially when we were supposed to be in Love with a capital <i>L</i>, making out and then dropping jokes like, &#x201c;Oh ha-ha, isn&#x2019;t scissoring just great?&#x201d; And at this point, Heather was a mom . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> The biggest kiss we ever had was in a scene right before Santana and Brittany&#x2019;s wedding, where the stage direction in the script said something like, &#x201c;They share a kiss they can&#x2019;t have in front of everyone else.&#x201d; Brad Buecker, who was directï¿½ing the episode, came up to us beforehand and gave us this bit of direction: &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;just really go at it.&#x201d; I guess I did it right, because my mom screamed when she watched the episode and thought I really had stuck my tongue down Heather&#x2019;s throat. (FYI: I didn&#x2019;t. The trick is you go in with an open mouth, then close it as soon as you make contact.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Like many things that went on to become major plot lines on <i>Glee</i>, Brittany and Santana&#x2019;s relationship started out as a joke. Late one season, Brittany made reference to the fact that she and Santana had hooked up. It was a casual line, and later I asked Brad Falchuk, who&#x2019;d written the episode, if Brittany and Santana really had a thing. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said. But when we came back from hiatus, he&#x2019;d figured it out: Santana was a lesbian.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first, I was just happy that she was getting a story line (because, hello, more screen time for me), but as that story progressed, we all started to see how much it was resonating with people. It was no longer a joke or a way to spice things up but something that we should take seriously. As each new episode aired, I would get tweets from people thanking me and telling me how important the story line was to them. The writers would get similar praise&#x2014;and also the occaï¿½sional death threat from a lesbian warning them that they&#x2019;d better not mess this up. I think we did a pretty good job; Santana and Brittany were able to show that a gay relationï¿½ship was just that&#x2014;a relationship, with no less or more of the ups and downs that happen in any relationship. <br> &nbsp;<br> With Santana, I hit my stride after season two. In the beï¿½ginning, she was super young, so her mean streak and cattiï¿½ness were very typically high school&#x2014;her insults were pointed and she looked for obvious weaknesses, like when she tells Rachel, &#x201c;Nobody ever tells you anything because (a) you&#x2019;re a blabbermouth, and (b) we all just pretend to like you.&#x201d; Ouch. <br> &nbsp;<br> I think people connected with her because everyone loves a good &#x201c;tell it like it is&#x201d; person, the only one who says what everyone is thinking. The more Santana&#x2019;s character develï¿½oped, the more she started to toss off insults casually, saying them as if she didn&#x2019;t care if they hit their mark. This effect often made them funnier&#x2014;and even more insulting. <br> &nbsp;<br> Being from Lima Heights Adjacent, she was hot-tempered and emotional, but as she grew up, I learned how to show that she internalized pain&#x2014;no sobbing necessary. I felt like I was growing up with the character because offsc...</p><h2>The First Book of Scales, Chords, Arpeggios &amp; Cadences: Includes All the Major, Harmonic Minor &amp; Chromatic Scales (Alfred's Basic Piano Library)</h2><p>Accomodates the learning pace of younger students such as those in Alfred's Basic, Level 2.

Mr. Walt Disney's movie <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> had come to Meriden.<br> My mother had read the true story of Snow White to my brother and me. I couldn't wait to see it in the movies. I thought Mr. Walt Disney was the best artist I had ever seen (I already knew that I wanted to be an artist, too). I loved his cartoons?especially "Silly Symphonies," Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and the Three Little Pigs. But now Mr. Walt Disney had done the first ever full-length animated movie?one and a half hours long.<br> I had been to a lot of movies?more than Buddy, even though he was eight. Because I didn't go to school yet, my mother took me with her to the movies in the afternoons. We both loved movies. My favorite movie stars were Shirley Temple, the little girl with blonde curls who could sing and dance better than anyone, and Miss Mae West. (I called her Miss because she was grown up while Shirley Temple was about my age. We always called grown-ups Miss, Mr., or Mrs.) Miss Mae West was blonde, too, and she could sing. She didn't dance, but she was all shiny and glittery and all she had to do was walk and talk and everyone in the movie theater laughed and laughed.<br> Mom, Buddy, and I went to see <i>Snow White </i>on a Saturday. We got in line early at the Capitol Theatre so that we could get good seats. My mom bought the tickets, and as we went into the lobby, music was playing. She bought each of us a box of Mason's Black Crows?little chewy licorice candies (they didn't have popcorn at the movies yet).<br> We found our seats. The lights went down. First we saw a newsreel (it was all the real things that were going on in the world). After that was the coming attraction about the next movie that would be shown at the Capitol. And finally, with the sound of trumpets, and glittery stars filling the screen, the words I had been waiting for: "Feature Presentation."<br> A big book appeared on the screen with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" on the front cover. The book opened. My mother read the words to me quietly: "Once upon a time..."<br> Music played, and there, in beautiful color, was Snow White, with white doves flying all around her. She was down on her knees, scrubbing the stairs in the Evil Queen's castle. Snow White asked the doves if they wanted to know a secret. They cooed yes. She told them they were standing by a wishing well. Then she sang a song about wishing for her prince to come.<br> WOW! I was really seeing <i>Snow White</i>, and it was the best movie I had ever seen. <br> Then the prince came on the screen and sang to Snow White. The Evil Queen, looking fierce and mean, watched. My brother sank down in his seat.<br> The Evil Queen went to her Magic Mirror and said the words I knew so well: "Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" The mirror said it was Snow White, and the Evil Queen looked angrier than ever. Buddy sank down even farther.<br> But he really freaked out when the Evil Queen ordered the huntsman to take Snow White into the woods to be killed, and the woods looked just like Hemlock Grove. Tree limbs grabbed at Snow White, and yellow eyes stared down at her.<br> It was scary, and I loved it. But lots of kids didn't, and suddenly I heard crying and screaming all around me, even from Buddy. "I want to go home!" he yelled. "Come on," my mother said, standing up. "Let's go."<br> "I'm not going," I said. I had waited a long time for Mr. Walt Disney's movie. My mom, who is probably the smartest woman in the world, understood. "All right, Tomie, sit right here and don't move. I'll be in the lobby with your brother." That was fine with me.<br> Lots of mothers left with their kids. I thought that was a good thing to do if the kids were afraid of the trees. They probably would wet their pants when the Evil Queen made the poisoned apple for Snow White and drank the magic potion to turn herself into the Evil Witch (even I was a little scared when that happened).<br> Then things about the story started to bother me. Why was the Evil Queen making the poisoned apple now? The true story was different. In that story, before the Evil Queen gave Snow White the apple, she went to the dwarfs' cottage and pulled the laces of Snow White's vest so tight that Snow White couldn't breathe and she fainted. The dwarfs came home just in time to loosen the laces and save her.<br> Next, the Queen went a second time to visit Snow White with a poison comb, which she stuck in Snow White's hair. Snow White fainted once more, but the dwarfs got back in time to take the comb out and save her again.<br> The <i>third </i>time was the poisoned apple.<br> Maybe Mr. Walt Disney hadn't read the true story, because he used only the apple. I stood up and shouted at the movie screen, "Where are the laces? Where is the comb?"<br> A lady behind me said, "Hush, little boy! Sit down." I did, and the movie was like the book again until the dwarfs put Snow White into the crystal coffin.<br> But I knew that Mr. Walt Disney hadn't read the true story carefully enough because he got it all mixed up with "Sleeping Beauty" and had the Prince kiss Snow White, and she woke up. In the true story the Prince carries the coffin to his palace, and on the way the piece of poisoned apple falls out of Snow White's mouth and she wakes up. But this time I didn't yell at the movie screen, in case the lady behind me got mad at me again.<br> But when "The End" appeared on the screen, boy, was I mad! I couldn't help it. I stood up and hollered, "The story's not over yet. Where's the wedding? Where's the red-hot iron shoes that they put on the Evil Queen so she dances herself to death?"<br> That was the true end of the true story. Just then my mom came running in, grabbed me, and dragged me out.<br> "Mr. Walt Disney didn't read the story right," I yelled again.<br> I never did understand it, and when I went to see <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs </i>again, with Carol Crane, I warned her that Mr. Walt Disney hadn't read the true story. I didn't yell at the movie screen. But I still wished I could have seen the Evil Queen dancing to death in those red-hot iron shoes!<b>copyright ?1999 by Tomie dePaola. Published by G.P.

His daddy was one of the biggest pimps in Milwaukee when I was growing up. Pimpin' was in Little Bear, not on him. Years ago, Little Bear was running an after-hours joint. Many pimps had these little clubs back in the day as a way of catching hoes. A bunch of us were in his joint when one of the finest hoes I ever saw walked in. She had a body like an hourglass. She was so fine her mama should have had triplets. She was just a gorgeous ho. The scene was live, but when this ho walked in, the place stopped.</p><p>Sammy, a half-ass pimp who was sitting in the corner blurted out, "That bitch so fine, she don't need no choosing fee to fuck with my pimpin'!"</p><p>Out of nowhere Little Bear jumped up and said, "Bitch, break yourself!" </p><p>She walks up to Little Bear and asks, "Mr. Bear, what can you do with this money that I can't do with it myself? If you can answer that, I will break myself."</p><p>"Bitch, I'm the pimp and you're the ho," he said. "So act like the quarterback and pass the motherfucking bankroll."</p><p>She smiled and gave him the trap money. Little Bear then turned to me. "That's a fine-ass bitch," he said. "As soon as she makes me twenty Gs, I'm going to have some buck-naked fun with her." Then he posed the same question he'd been asked to me. "Pimpin', what could <i>you</i> do with that money?"</p><p>I stood up, because I was about to perform, and I wanted everyone to hear. "For the record," I started, "I mean to say, for the album -- because the record is too short -- if any of you suckers want to know what a pimp can do with that money that a bitch can't, go to the motherfucking hardware store, get you some duct tape, tape that money on the wall, and piss on it. That's what a pimp can do that a bitch can't!"</p><p></p><p><b>The Ism</b></p><p>"Purse first, ass last" is the motto of pimpin', the very foundation on which pimpin' is built. What separates a pimp from a trick is that a pimp completely flips the game. A trick pays a ho for the pussy, but a ho doesn't get to fuck a pimp until <i>she pays him.</i> A ho has got to put it in a pimp's pocket like a rocket before pimpin' can begin. It's not about a pimp breaking a ho, it's about a ho breaking herself. Violating this first law will guarantee a pimp a career of troubles and stress. If a woman can try you before she buy you, then, as B.B. King says, "The thrill is gone." </p><p>In life what is expensive seems valuable, and what's available for free seems worthless. You've heard that no one buys the cow when the milk is free, but what they didn't tell you is that after a while, no one even wants that free milk. To be valued, the key is not to give, but to receive -- the more, the better. You don't want to "earn" your price, you want to "cost" it. This is the psychology behind the whole game: anything worth having, you must pay for up front.</p><p></p><p>Copyright ï¿½ 2007 by Ken Ivy</p></p><h2>10 Wonders of the Rosary</h2><p>Called &#34;the New Testament on a string of beads,&#34; the Rosary is presented by famed Mariologist Fr.

Photo Gallery in the back of the book.</strong></p><p><strong>True story of child abuse.</strong>&nbsp;When Misty Griffin was six years old, her family started to live and dress like the Amish. Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch and subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse, and extreme physical violence. Their step-father kept a loaded rifle by the door to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. No rescue would ever come since the few people who knew they existed did not care.</p><p><strong>Sexual abuse among the Amish.</strong>&nbsp;When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community. Devastated to again find herself in a world of fear, cruelty, and abuse, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. As Misty recalls, "Amish sexual abusers are only shunned by the church for six weeks, a punishment that never seems to work....I knew I had to get help, and one freezing morning in early March, I made a dash for a tiny police station in rural Minnesota. After reporting the bishop, I left the Amish and found myself plummeted into a strange modern world with only a second-grade education and no ID or social security card."</p><p><strong>Misty has a message for abuse survivors:</strong>&nbsp;"Please be encouraged, the cycle of abuse can be broken. This is my story of survival and moving past the abuse to embrace my dreams." In June 2019 Misty graduated nursing school.

Or so claims its melodramatic ghost narrator. You can go ahead and turn the page, but don&#39;t expect him to come with you. Anything might pop out of that black hole in the middle of the forest. What do you mean it&#39;s just a bunny? Well, it&#39;s probably a bunny with big fangs. Watch out, it&#39;s--picking pumpkins with its friends, you say? Actually, despite the ghost&#39;s scare-mongering, none of the animal characters in the illustrations seem scary at all. . . . What&#39;s up with that? Many delights, such as surprises after the page turn, an alarmist narrator, and punch lines to anticipate make this book a scream for both kids and parents.</p><p><b>Bob Shea</b> (www.bobshea.com) is the author-illustrator of THE HAPPIEST BOOK EVER, three books about Ballet Cat, the Dinosaur vs. series, and several other picture books, including DON'T PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD and UNICORN THINKS HE'S PRETTY GREAT. He lives and works in Madison, Connecticut.<br> <br><br>K-Gr 2&#x2014;Silliness abounds in Shea's latest work. The narrator, a small ghost, doesn't want readers to go into the scary woods, because it is full of frightening things. He'd rather stay home and wash his sheet and eat doughnuts. He's skeptical when he hears about a cute bunny, cupcakes, and Halloween party but agrees to go into the woods to save readers from the super scary monsters. When he goes into the woods he is frightened away by the monsters, but then learns that it is just the animals in costume. He enjoys the joke, the party, and the cupcakes. The book is full of funny artwork with bright colors and comic characters. Children will get a laugh at the ghost's belly full of doughnuts. The realization that the ghost is essentially naked after taking off his sheet to wash will also amuse young readers. VERDICT A hilarious book that will keep the giggles coming, this will be a hit for Halloween read-alouds.&#x2014;V.

The <em>FAMILY MEETING!</em> sign is up in her house, and she just knows she's in trouble for something. Has she been too mean to her little brother? Too sloppy? Eating too much junk food? Try as she might to find out what's on the agenda, her parents won't reveal anything before the meeting. As far as Clementine is concerned, the agenda should be something like: "We're getting a gorilla." But no, it's something entirely different. "We're talking about a new baby," says her father. "A brother or sister for you two. What do you think about that?"&nbsp;NO THANKS!&nbsp;is what Clementine thinks.&nbsp;After all, <em>four</em> is the perfect number for a family. There are four sides to a table, not five. Will Clementine learn to make room for one more?<br>&nbsp;<br>Readers will&nbsp;chuckle at&nbsp;Clementine's unique perspective on the&nbsp;age-old issue of sibling rivalry. <br></p><p>Sara Pennypacker (www.sarapennypacker.com) is the author of four previous Clementine books and <i>Sparrow Girl</i>, illustrated by Yoko Tanaka. She divides her time between Texas and Massachusetts. <br><br><br>Marla Frazee (www.marlafrazee.com) has illustrated all of the Clementine books and many other beloved titles. She has been awarded a Caldecott Honor on two occasions, for <em>All the World</em> by Liz Garton Scanlon, and for <i>A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever</i>, which she also wrote. She lives in Pasadena, California, where she works in a small backyard cabin under an avocado tree.Clementine has had many not-so-good days. But this one just might be the worst. She loses her favorite hat, her science project is ruined and the "family meeting!" sign is up on the refrigerator-that's never a good thing. Even though family meetings are supposed to be about family issues, Clementine usually ends up getting in trouble. But this one is different. Clementine's dad announces that their family is going to grow. Are they are getting a gorilla, like Clementine has always wanted?! No. It's a new baby. Clementine is N-O-T, not happy. They are a family of four. Four is a perfect number. In infallible Clementine reasoning: "Four can be two and two sometimes, and nobody is lonely. Two kids and two grown-ups. Two boys and two girls. There are four sides to the kitchen table, so we each get one." Five just doesn't work. Pennypacker tackles the oft-written new-baby theme from a refreshing, older perspective; jealousy is not the foremost emotion, it's vulnerability. Everything is changing too fast. Clementine and her dad have always had a unique bond, but in this venture, he especially shines. He picks up on unspoken feelings and knows just how to give the right amount of comfort. Filled with familiar Clementine charm but, more importantly, a whole lot of heart, too. Kirkus"<br><br>Something is always up with third-grader Clementine. Here, it's her worries about a family meeting and the disappearance of the rat she and her friend Waylon are using in a science experiment. The mystery of the family meeting is solved early on-there's a new baby on the way. Unraveling her feelings about this event takes up most of the book. The whereabouts of the rat is also resolved, though in a way some readers might see coming. This entry in the popular, ongoing series is once again illustrated by Frazee's delightful pictures. Booklist"<br><br>Clementine knows that a family meeting means trouble, and when her mother won't give her an advance peek at the agenda, Clementine is really worried. Is she smiling enough? Being nice to her brother? Using her best manners? Nothing can prepare our heroine for the bombshell her parents launch: there will be a new baby in the house. Clementine's reaction is less than enthusiastic. "Our family is four. There are four sides to a puzzle so we can all work on it at once Four is the perfect number for a family!" Clementine's friends are changing, too. Margaret has become a "makeup fiend," and Waylon, her science class buddy, is suddenly obsessed with his self-professed superpowers. Even Eighteen, the rat who was supposed to be the star of their science project, has run away. Clementine's father reassures her by admitting that he understands her ambivalence about the new baby. And when Clementine calls a family meeting of her own, readers will see how much she has matured in just a few years and can imagine what a great big sister she will make. Clementine is becoming a more complex character as she matures, and fans of this fine series will enjoy the nuanced way she has grown more trustworthy and mature while staying true to herself. Horn Book"<br><br>Clementine's fifth adventure for early chapter-book readers addresses a topic many children can relate to. The third-grader's parents call a family meeting to announce that a new baby is on the way. Clementine's reaction to the news is realistic she says "No thanks!" She argues that four is the perfect number for a family, for reasons as varied as there are four sides to a puzzle to the fact that hot dogs come in packages of eight, so a family of four can have two each. Her parents are a little surprised by her reaction but take the time to try to understand how she is feeling and demonstrate how special she is to them. Through some humorous conversations with her friends, grandparents, and teacher, Clementine changes her perspective on the situation. This is a solid entry in the series, and it will surely keep readers wanting more.

Shaw's tongue-twisting rhymes, which here chronicle five sheep's attempt to eat at a tearoom, are as simply clever as ever. From the start, it's clear that this crew is out of its element. After feline waiters bring them menus, the sheep "point to words that they can't read." When "Waiters bring them spinach custard," the sheep "add sugar, salt, and mustard." Things go downhill quickly--and riotously--after the diners put pepper on their cake and begin sneezing wildly, upsetting tables and sending cups and dishes crashing to the floor. Asked to leave the premises, "Sheep pout. Sheep walk out. Suddenly they look about." The faces on Apple's wonderfully expressive creatures suddenly light up, for what they see is a lush lawn, which seems a perfect lunchtime munch.

Although the two are not the same, most estate planners today do not even broach this concept with their clients or include the less-tangible aspects of wealth as they draft an estate plan. They simply develop an estate plan that prepares the family&#x2019;s financial assets to be dumped, divided, deferred, and dissipated among the members of the next generation. These estate plans typically reflect a very linear way of thinking. In other words, if transferring some amount of financial wealth is good, then transferring more financial wealth is better. Not only is this approach is myopic and simplistic, but it&#x2019;s ultimately destructive because it focuses on the fire (the result) and not on the flint and kindling (the tools and resources that produce the result).</p> <p><em>Entrusted</em> lays out the foundations of Entrusted Planning process, which aligns the principles and values of a family with their tangible assets and prepares future generations to build a true and lasting legacy. It&#x2019;s a process that draws from the very origins of estate law, which placed the highest value on who was involved&#x2014;on who was entrusted. Entrusted Planning goes back to preparing beneficiaries for wealth beyond just the legal concept of a trust and takes into account the relational maturation of the person or persons being entrusted as stewards of resources, not just consumers and users of it.&nbsp; Entrusted Planning is about transferring opportunities instead of just assets and doing so over multiple generations.&nbsp;</p> <p>By focusing on the means to an end (education, personal character, home ownership, entrepreneurship, charitable service) as opposed to the end (stocks, bonds, real estate, and businesses), Entrusted Planning has the greatest potential to do the maximum amount of multigenerational good with the least amount of collateral damage. Entrusted families have goals that are both deep and broad. They&#x2019;re less interested in preparing their families to be <em>rich</em> and more interested in preparing them to manage, sustain, and carry on a <em>rich legacy</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Entrusted</em> outlines seven core disciplines that can be found across a multitude of successful high-net-worth families going back hundreds of years. These are not hypothetical or idealistic disciplines. These disciplines are real and permeate through the families who have embraced these concepts.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Discipline 1.</em> Entrusted families know who they are and what they believe.</p> <p><em>Discipline</em> <em>2.</em> Entrusted families prepare the family for the wealth and not just the wealth for the family.</p> <p><em>Discipline</em> <em>3.</em> Entrusted families maximize the positive benefits of wealth and minimize the negative effects.</p> <p><em>Discipline 4.</em> Entrusted families focus on flint and kindling and not on the fire.</p> <p><em>Discipline 5.</em> Entrusted families are generous.</p> <p><em>Discipline 6.</em> Entrusted families preserve and protect wealth.</p> <p><em>Discipline 7.</em> Entrusted families design and implement dynamic governance.</p> <p>When a family gets to the point where they are putting their wealth behind a statement such as &#x201c;We are the Smiths. This is what we believe in, this is what we value, and this is what we do to impact the world,&#x201d; they will produce successive generations who can be <em>Entrusted</em>.</p></p><p></p><h2>Olympians: Artemis: Wild Goddess of the Hunt (Olympians, 9)</h2><p>Shunned even before she was born and destined to live a life of solitude, Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt, finds power through her skilled hunting ability and mighty bow.

It&#x2019;s a quick read from a detectorist who&#x2019;s been swinging a machine long enough to know how to do it successfully, but who hasn&#x2019;t forgotten what it feels like to be just beginning and needing a place to start smart.

Plus you get a section of Bonus Material: A list of the same resources the author uses to stay current in the hobby! So lose those newbie blues: Read this guide and get out there, for memorable days of saving history. Happy hunting!</p><p>This small volume is a wealth of information written in an easy-to-understand format. The sub-title, &#34;101 Things I Wish I&#39;d Known When I Started,&#34; says that you will find many helpful tips and lots of advice. The title may say, &#34;For Beginners,&#34; but even longtime diggers can learn a thing or two from this softcover book. The author, Mary Shafer, may be considered a &#34;newbie&#34; by some old-timers&#39; standards, but that is what I think makes the book so good. She brings her passion and love for the hobby to this book. She has been digging for a dozen years and what she has learned from experience is shared in this guide. She explains the basics and continues guiding the digger into this hobby. As noted detectorist D.J. Yost says in the foreword: &#34;After reading Mary&#39;s book, I have to admit there were a lot of thingsI&#39;d forgotten about experiencing as a beginner.&#34; She is also generous with her praise of the many folks who helped her learn and enjoy the hobby even more. We all had to begin at some point, and taking the time to put all she has learned into this book is a welcome gift to detectorists. After the introduction, the books begins with an eleven-page Glossary of Vocabulary and Slang. I&#39;m glad she included the slang, because old time diggers, often forgetting that beginners don&#39;t know the terminology, rattle off terms that can be confusing. Ms. Shafer helps it all make sense. The heart of the book is the &#34;101 Things.&#34; These are divided into categories, which will help the reader find the tip or answer they seek. The first 20 are about the hobby and type of digging you enjoy. The next 28 are about equipment, sub-divided into &#34;Must-Haves, Accessories,&#34; and &#34;Nice-To-Haves.&#34; My only disagreement here is that I would place headphones in the &#34;Must-Haves,&#34; section rather than &#34;Nice-To-Haves.&#34; Although detectorists love to hear the beep of a target, those around you (other diggers, onlookers, sunbathers, picnickers, etc.) may not want to hear it. Also, I think you best hear nuances of beeps with headphones rather than without. Batteries last longer when you use headphones, too. Numbers 49 through 70 cover &#34;Finding Hunting Spots.&#34; This is a very extensive list with tips about getting permissions and knowing the laws in the areas you hunt. This section I think is very important for beginners to read. The last section, &#34;Hunting,&#34; covers a bit more of the basic, but easily overlooked, tasks that enhance the metal detecting experience, as well as the safety, etiquette (including the Metal Detectorist&#39;s Code of Ethics), weird stuff, and finds. The book ends with a &#34;Bonus Section on Resources,&#34; beginning with your machine&#39;s owner&#39;s manual and moving on to social media, books, magazines and more. For a small pocket guide book, this one packs a lot of helpful information into its 108 pages (including an index). I would suggest every beginner in the hobby own a copy, but experienced diggers can benefit as well.</p><h2>Donde viven los monstruos</h2><p><p><em>This high-quality Spanish-language book can be enjoyed by fluent Spanish speakers as well as those learning the language, whether at home or in a classroom.</em></p><p><em>Donde viven los monstruos</em> tiene cincuenta aï¿½os de publicaciï¿½n.

French, it was adapted to American English by Faith Annette Sand.<p>By the grace of God I am a Christian man, by my actions a great sinner, and by calling a homeless wanderer of the humblest birth who roams from place to place. My worldly goods are a knapsack with some dried bread in it on my back, and in my breastpocket a Bible. And that is all.</p><p>On the twenty-fourth Sunday after Pentecost I went to church to say my prayers there during the liturgy. The first Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians was being read, and among other words I heard these--"Pray without ceasing." It was this text, more than any other, which forced itself upon my mind, and I began to think how it was possible to pray without ceasing, since a man has to concern himself with other things also in order to make a living. I looked at my Bible and with my own eyes read the words which I had heard, that is, that we ought always, at all times and in all places, to pray with uplifted hands. I thought and thought, but knew not what to make of it. "What ought I to do?" I thought. "Where shall I find someone to explain it to me? I will go to the churches where famous preachers are to be heard; perhaps there I shall hear something that will throw light on it for me." I did so. I heard a number of very fine sermons on prayer--what prayer is, how much we need it, and what its fruits are--but no one said how one could succeed in prayer. I heard a sermon on spiritual prayer, and unceasing prayer, but how it was to be done was not pointed out.</p><p>Thus listening to sermons failed to give me what I wanted, and having had my fill of them without gaining understanding, I gave up going to hear public sermons. I settled on another plan--by God's help to look for some experienced and skilled person who would give me in conversation that teaching about unceasing prayer which drew me so urgently.</p><p>For a long time I wandered through many places. I read my Bible always, and everywhere I asked whether there was not in the neighborhood a spiritual teacher, a devout and experienced guide, to be found. One day I was told that in a certain village a gentleman had long been living and seeking the salvation of his soul. He had a chapel in his house. He never left his estate, and he spent his time in prayer and reading devotional books. Hearing this, I ran rather than walked to the village named. I got there and found him.</p><p>"What do you want of me?" he asked.</p><p>"I have heard that you are a devout and clever person," said 1. "In God's name please explain to me the meaning of the Apostle's words, 'Pray without ceasing.' How is it possible to pray without ceasing? I want to know so much, but I cannot understand it at all."</p><p>He was silent for a while and looked at me closely. Then he said, "Ceaseless interior prayer is a continual yearning of the human spirit toward God. To succeed in this consoling exercise we must pray more often to God to teach us to pray without ceasing. Pray more, and pray more fervently. It is prayer itself which will reveal to you how it can be achieved unceasingly; but it will take some time."</p><p>So saying, he had food brought to me, gave me money for my journey, and let me go.</p><p>He did not explain the matter.</p><p>Again I set off. I thought and thought, I read and read, I dwelt over and over again upon what this man had said to me, but I could not get to the bottom of it. Yet so greatly did I wish to understand that I could not sleep at night.</p><p>I walked at least 125 miles, and then I came to a large town, a provincial capital, where I saw a monastery. At the inn where I stopped I heard it said that the abbot was a man of great kindness, devout and hospitable. I went to see him. He met me in a very friendly manner, asked me to sit down, and offered me refreshment.</p><p>"I do not need refreshment, holy Father," I said, "but I beg you to give me some spiritual teaching. How can I save my soul?"</p><p>"What? Save your soul? Well, live according to the commandments, say your prayers, and you will be saved."</p><p>"But I hear it said that we should pray without ceasing, and I don't know how to pray without ceasing. I cannot even understand what unceasing prayer means. I beg you, Father, explain this to me."</p><p>"I don't know how to explain further, dear brother. But, stop a moment, I have a little book, and it is explained there." And he handed me St. Dmitri's book, on <i>The Spiritual Education of the Inner Man</i>, saying, "Look, read this page."</p><p>I began to read as follows: "The words of the Apostle, 'Pray without ceasing,' should be understood as referring to the creative prayer of the understanding. The understanding can always be reaching out toward God and praying to Him unceasingly."</p><p>"But," I asked, "what is the method by which the understanding can always be turned toward God, never be disturbed, and pray without ceasing?"</p><p>"It is very difficult, even for one to whom God Himself gives such a gift," replied the abbot.</p></p><h2>Present Over Perfect Study Guide: Leaving Behind Frantic for a Simpler, More Soulful Way of Living</h2><p><p>In this five session video Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately), New York Times bestselling author Shauna Niequist invites you on a journey that changed her life. She will walk a path with you, a path away from frantic pushing and proving, and toward your essential self, the one you were created to be before you began proving and earning of your worth.</p><p>Shauna will help you begin leaving behind busyness and frantic living and rediscovering the person you were made to be. Present Over Perfect is a hand reaching out, pulling you free from the constant pressure to perform faster, push harder, and produce more, all while maintaining an exhausting image of perfection. She offers an honest account of what led her to begin this journey, and a compelling vision for an entirely new way to live: soaked in grace, rest, silence, simplicity, prayer, and connection with the people that matter most to us.</p><p>The study guide includes first thoughts, video notes, group discussion questions, practicing presence reflections, and solo work for you to complete between sessions.</p><p>Sessions include:</p><ol><li>Pain Points</li><li>The Roles We Play</li><li>Yes, And No</li><li>Unflashy, Unspectacular, Good</li><li>Living the Love</li></ol><p>Designed for use with the <em>Present Over Perfect Video Study&nbsp;</em>9780310816034 (sold separately).</p></p><p><p>Shauna Niequist is the author of <em>Cold Tangerines</em>, <em>Bittersweet</em>, <em>Bread &amp; Wine</em> and <em>Savor</em>. She is married to Aaron, and they have two wild and silly and darling boys, Henry and Mac. They live outside Chicago, where Aaron leads The Practice and is recording a project called A New Liturgy. Shauna also writes for the Storyline Blog, and for IF:Table, she is a member of the Relevant podcast, and a guest teacher at her church. Shauna&#x2019;s three great loves are her family, dinner parties, and books, and she believes that vulnerable storytelling, hard laughter, and cold pizza for breakfast can cure almost anything.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Ashley Wiersma is a freelance writer of spiritual books and curricula. She and her husband and daughter make their home in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.</p>Returning to the theme of decluttering everyday life and concentrating on what is truly important, Niequist (Savor) weaves together a series of essays concerning her personal experiences overcoming a life overwrought with busyness, stress, and feelings of inadequacy. After years of frantic living, Niequist has come to the realization that she&#x2019;s missing out on the beauty of everyday life with her husband and children---that it will all speed past her if she doesn&#x2019;t slow down and simplify, learn how to say no to demands on her time, and stop worrying about others&#x2019; opinions of her. &#x201c;Present over perfect living is real over image, connecting over comparing, meaning over mania, depth over artifice,&#x201d; she writes, explaining along the way that she&#x2019;s found a new &#x201c;strength&#x201d; in embracing quiet surroundings and in spending time alone. To emphasize her points, she quotes Scripture, but does so sparingly and intentionally---more often than not, her included references to her faith are intended only to bolster her own experiences of mindful living. Her style is conversational, friendly, inviting, and never heavy-handed, making the book accessible to people of all faiths. Women will find the advice hits closest to home. Niequist&#x2019;s latest book is her most satisfying blend of mindfulness, scripture, and self-help to date, offering readers the blueprint for a life lived in the real instead of the ideal. ( <i>- Publishers Weekly</i>) <br> <br>I begged Shauna for this manuscript a year ago while it was half-baked. When I finally received it, I read it from cover to cover in one sitting, then sat down at my laptop and wrote four emails bowing out of engagements that no longer fit my life, made two hard phone calls, and gave an end date to two other commitments. Present Over Perfect loaned me the courage, integrity, and permission I&#x2019;d been waiting for. I will go to the grave thankful for this message. It has changed my life. ( <i>&#x2015;Jennifer Hatmaker, author of For the Love and 7</i>) <br> <br>Most of the teachers I&#x2019;ve had didn&#x2019;t think they were teaching me anything; they just thought we were friends. Shauna is that kind of friend, and this is that kind of book. As you turn these pages, you&#x2019;ll be reminded about what you have loved, where you&#x2019;ve found your joy, and perhaps what you&#x2019;ve misplaced along the way. Most of all, you&#x2019;ll be guided into an honest conversation about your faith and where you want to go with it. ( <i>&#x2015;Bob Goff, author of Love Does</i>) <br> <br>I cried tears of relief while inhaling Present Over Perfect. I cried because I&#x2019;d completely forgotten that I don&#x2019;t have to earn worthiness, hustle for love, or fight to belong. Shauna&#x2019;s words---equal parts elegant and urgent---invited me to remember that my worthiness, belonging, and beloved-ness are birthrights. I can&#x2019;t think of a more important, more desperately needed invitation. ( <i>&#x2015;Glennon Doyle Melton, author of Love Warrior and the New York Times bestseller Carry On, Warrior, founder of Momastery and Together Rising</i>) <br> <br>I&#x2019;ve watched Shauna walk this journey away from proving and pushing toward connection and grace, and as a friend, I&#x2019;m proud of her. As a reader, I&#x2019;m thankful to have these pages as an inspiration and guide. For all of us who yearn for meaningful, connected lives but find ourselves sometimes settling for busy, her words are the push we&#x2019;ve been waiting for. ( <i>&#x2015;Donald Miller, New York Times bestselling author of Scary Close and Blue Like Jazz</i>) <br> <br>Shauna awakens our desire to not miss our lives. Because that pursuit costs us our distracting habits, we need motivation beyond disciplines and rules. We have to want to really live and be with our people and enjoy this gift of a life that God has given us. Shauna&#x2019;s life makes me not want to miss mine, and her words here will make you not want to miss yours. ( <i>&#x2015;Jennie Allen, founder and visionary of IF:Gathering, author of Anything and Restless</i>) <br> <br>We live in a society that can easily have us running in circles if we aren&#x2019;t careful. And this can result in having a life full of things we actually never intended to sign up for. Shauna helps us take a step back and reset our minds and souls. In these pages you will find wisdom and encouragement to see past temporal success and accolades to experience the deeper, more connected and truly enjoyable life. After all, it is the power of connection with others that helps us thrive in every sense of the word. ( <i>&#x2015;Dr. Henry Cloud, New York Times bestselling author of Boundaries and The Power of the Other</i>) <br> <br>I have already read this book seven times. It&#x2019;s about pursuing the present over the perfect---but it is nonetheless a nearly perfect thing, a nearly perfect book. Shauna speaks exactly to my condition. ( <i>&#x2015;Lauren Winner, author of Girl Meets God, Still, and Wearing God</i>) <br> <br>With graceful confession, Shauna has created a memoir of her heart---a racing, fragmented heart that is becoming a contented, loved, and present heart. Reading this book heartened me for her, for her family, for her church, and for her generation. Shauna summons each of us to resist being sucked into the fast-paced draft of saying Yes and offers us a better way: the way of presence, the way of saying No. But this No is a Yes to something far better.

Dr Karim is the founder of the Science of BioGeometry in the early 1970s. BioGeometry is the science that uses shapes, colors, motion and sound to induce harmony into the subtle energy qualities of the environment. At the core of this harmony is a subtle energy quality found in the transcendental centers of the forming process of nature and is the main quality in sacred power spots of humanity that give a spiritual dimension to the timeless monuments erected since the dawn of humanity. With his experience as an architect and a scientist Dr. Karim has synergized aspects of Pythagorean Harmonics, Subtle energy sciences, Radiesthesia, Geobiology, Building Biology, Sacred Architecture &amp; modern wave theories to produce a new Physics of Quality from which the science of BioGeometry emerged. *BioGeometry bridges science and spirituality to produce a natural harmony into the environment. *BioGeometry provides a viable solution in transforming the quality of the effect that electromagnetic radiation has on living systems. Successful projects in Switzerland in collaboration &amp; acknowledgment of Swiss authorities prove its efficiency to take our modern science into the future. *BioGeometry provides new solutions to Earth Radiation, which is a serious health hazard if not acknowledged in the location and design of our buildings. * A new energy-quality-based analysis of the Great Pyramid in Giza, reveals new knowledge on the foremost of the wonders of the world and on the essence of the great Ancient Egyptian civilization.</p><p>Ibrahim Karim, Ph.D. /Dr.Sc. is a graduate of the prestigious Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland. Founder of the qualitative science of BioGeometry &amp; the new Architecture and industrial design school that uses the subtle energy effect of geometrical shapes to induce harmony to our modern technological or natural environments. He currently teaches at several universities and supervises numerous postgraduate studies on the applications of the science of BioGeometry. Dr. Karim was recognized and honored by several institutes for his work in the environment and was chosen as man of the year by the Swiss magazine "Anzeiger" in 2005 for his success in reducing the effect of 'electrosmog' in several regions in Switzerland. These projects were done in collaboration with the Swiss Mediation Authority for Telecommunication &amp; Environment, Swisscom the main cellular provider and the Local Governments. The results received wide media acclaim and were featured in several documentaries on the Swiss National Television.

He was a highly successful businessman, had a beautiful wife and daughter, and, only in his early thirties, had his whole life in front of him. To avoid the same fate as his father and grandfather, who both died of heart attacks at a young age, James became an avid runner&#x2015;a passion that he believed helped him stay fit and healthy. Imagine his shock when, during a routine physical, his doctor noticed a mole on his body that turned out to be a melanoma&#x2015;a dangerous form of skin cancer. The mole was removed immediately and James, who was diligent in his follow-up exams, appeared to be cancer-free&#x2015;but only for a short while. When the cancer reappeared and had spread, on the advice of his doctor, James followed the conventional medical protocol, which included surgery and chemotherapy. He was also involved in a clinical trial. When he learned that the treatments weren&#x2019;t working, James was obviously devastated. He had reached a new low point in his life, and as he lay in the hospital bed, he prayed fervently for help.

It is here that Ayla finds her first women friends, but some among the Mamutoi dislike Ayla because she was raised by &#x201c;flatheads,&#x201d; their name for the people of the Clan. Ayla is haunted by her memories of the Clan because Rydag, a child of mixed parentage living with the Mamutoi, bears so strong a resemblance to her own son, Durc.<br><br>It is the Mamutoi master carver of ivory--dark-skinned Ranec, flirtatious, artistic, magnetic--who fascinates Ayla.

To learn more, please visit philip-pullman.com and hisdarkmaterials.com. Or follow him on Twitter at @PhilipPullman.The fairy tale quality of Philip Pullman's latest is enhanced by Graeme Malcolm's gentle, almost singsong, narration. A scarecrow, brought to life by a freak lightning strike, and an orphan boy, Jack, embark on a quest to reclaim Spring Valley from the corrupt Buffaloni family. They drift from disaster to disaster, dogged by an oily lawyer working for the Buffalonis, but the overall tone remains silly enough that none of it ever feels truly threatening. Malcolm has plenty of opportunities to exercise a variety of accents (although why people with Italian surnames all sound British is an unresolved mystery). The fantastic Grand Congress of Birds allows Malcolm the chance for more vocal acrobatics. Younger listeners will be intrigued by the talking birds and the subtle central conflict of industry versus conservation.

Now in English, Walther s sermons will give readers today a peek into the powerful preaching of the first president of the LCMS.<br>The sermons are printed unchanged as to content and form. They originate from the author s almost 30-year activity as pastor of the first German Ev. Lutheran (Joint) congregation of the Unaltered Augsburg Confession in this country, which for some time past consists of four areas with four churches: Trinity, Immanuel, Zion, and Cross Churches.<br>People who read these sermons will experience the explanation of God s Word by C. F. W. Walther and lead people to the insight that they are as Christians a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His [God s] own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light (1 Peter 2:9). This was the bible verse Walther put on one of the first pages of the German edition of his Gospel sermons. This also should be the motto of this volume.</p><p></p><h2>A Monk Swimming</h2><p>Slapped with a libel suit after an appearance on a talk show, Malachy McCourt crows, "If they could only see me now in the slums of Limerick, a big shot, sued for a million. Bejesus, isn't America a great and wonderful country?" His older brother Frank's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, <em>Angela's Ashes</em>, took its somber tone from the bleak atmosphere of those slums, while Malachy's boisterous recollections are fueled by his zestful appreciation for the opportunities and oddities of his native land.<br><br> He and Frank were born in Brooklyn, moved with their parents to Ireland as children, then returned to the States as adults. This book covers the decade 1952-63, when Malachy roistered across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but spent most of his time in New York City. There his ready wit and quick tongue won him an acting job with the Irish Players, a semiregular stint on <em>The Tonight Show</em> hosted by Jack Paar, and friendships with some well-heeled, well-born types who shared his fondness for saloon life and bankrolled him in an East Side saloon that may have been the first singles bar. He chronicles those events--and many others--with back-slapping bonhomie.<br><br> Although McCourt acknowledges the personal demons that pursued him from his poverty-stricken childhood and destroyed his first marriage, this is on the whole an exuberant autobiography that pays tribute to the joys of a freewheeling life.</p><p>Malachy McCourt, barman, actor, raconteur, is Frank&#39;s (Angela&#39;s Ashes) younger brother. He is married and lives in New York.There was always the story in any gathering in Limerick. Be it boys, girls, the men, the women, bald facts were considered cold and inhuman; therefore all storied events had to be wrapped in words. Warm words, serried words, glittering, poetic, harsh, and even blasphemous words. <p> So the cold evenings were made warm with myths and tales of dirty doings and derring-do, and horrific yarns of the tortures of hell awaiting the evildoer. We the children sat in darkness, shivering in horrored delight, having been told we had two ears and unready tongue. </p><p> My father, Malachy, and his chums, Mr. Meehan, Mr. Looney, and Mr. Moran, spun out the silver-gold yarns and, by sheer eloquence, made our miserable surroundings disappear. And my father would sing his patriotic odes to Ireland, like the one about Roddy McCorley going to die on the bridge of Toome. My mother sang droopy love songs like, ``We Are in Love with You, My Heart and I.'' </p><p> Death brought a silence to our house. First Baby Margaret Mary and then the twins--Eugene at four, and Oliver, four-and-a-half. Poverty killed them. My father left, to go on a lifelong drinking binge, never to come back, and I hated him for depriving me of him. It was many years before my mother sang another droopy love song, because she sank into a deep depression and love fled into the damp, grey Limerick sky, never to return. </p><p> The poor will always be with us, it sez in the Bible, and having had the strange privilege of being born into a not poor, but poverty-stricken, family, it became my passionate intention to be always with someone, but, by the living Jesus Christ, I would not be poor or poverty stricken. </p><p> I did not like being damp all the time. I did not like being cold and wet in the winter. I did not like looking in windows of shops filled with meats sweets biscuits breads, and my eyes bulging, the mouth aching for the chance to chew on something substantial. I did not like being eaten by fleas, gorging themselves on my bitter blood. I did not like having lice and nits in my hair my arse my armpits my eyebrows and every seam of the trousers and gansey I wore. I didn't like the boils and pimples on my small epidermis, not to mention the shame of scabies and ringworm. I didn't like having badly patched clothes and broken boots that Van Gogh would have sneered at. I didn't like having caked shit in my trousers because they couldn't be washed for the want of a replacement to wear while they were drying. I didn't like being made fun of and sneered at by the upper classes, who had tea and buns in the afternoon and electric light in every room. </p><p> I have never liked the smell of the newly made, newly varnished coffins that were brought in to take away our dead forever. </p><p> I was a smiley little fella with a raging heart and murderous instincts. One day I would show THEM--yes, you rotten fucking arsehole counter-jumping stuck-up jumped-up whore's-melts nose-holding tuppence-ha'penny-looking-down-on-tuppence snobs. I'll go back to America where I was born and I'll fart in yer faces. </p><p> And I did.</p><p></p></p><h2>Aunty Lee&#39;s Deadly Specials: A Singaporean Mystery (The Aunty Lee Series, 2)</h2><p><p>Rosie &#x201c;Aunty&#x201d; Lee, the feisty widow, amateur sleuth, and proprietor of Singapore&#x2019;s best-loved home cooking restaurant, is back in another delectable, witty mystery involving scandal and murder among the city&#x2019;s elite.</p><p>Few know more about what goes on in Singapore than Aunty Lee.

So when a family moved into the house across the street, Betsy hoped they would have a little girl she could play with. Sure enough, they did. The girl's name was Tacy, and after a while she and Betsy became such good friends that everybody thought of them as one person - Betsy-Tacy. <p>Betsy-Tacy did all kinds of things. They made a playhouse from a piano box. They went to their first day of school together and even sat in the same seat. They rode in the milkman's wagon. And Betsy made up wonderful stories that they kept as their own special secrets. Then they met Tib, who came to share in their games. </p><p>Ever since their first publication in the 1940s, the Betsy-Tacy stories have been loved by each generation of young readers.</p></p><p><p>Maud Hart Lovelace (1892-1980) based her Betsy-Tacy series on her own childhood. Her series still boasts legions of fans, many of whom are members of the Betsy-Tacy Society, a national organization based in Mankato, Minnesota.</p><b><p>Chapter One</p></b>Betsy Meets Tacy<p></p><p>It was difficult, later, to think of a time when Betsy and Tacy had not been friends. Hill Street came to regard them almost as one person. Betsy&#x2019;s brown braids went with Tacy&#x2019;s red curls, Betsy&#x2019;s plump legs with Tacy&#x2019;s spindly ones, to school and from school, up hill and down, on errands and in play. So that when Tacy had the mumps and Betsy was obliged to make her journeys alone, saucy boys teased her: "Where&#x2019;s the cheese, apple pie?" "Where&#x2019;s your mush, milk?" As though she didn&#x2019;t feel lonesome enough already! And Hill Street knew when Sunday came, even without listening to the rolling bells, for Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly (whose parents attended different churches), set off down Hill Street separately, looking uncomfortable and strange.</p><p>But on this March afternoon, a month before Betsy&#x2019;s fifth birthday, they did not know each other. They had not even seen each other, unless Betsy had glimpsed Tacy, without knowing her for Tacy, among the children of assorted sizes moving into the house across the street. Betsy had been kept in because of bad weather, and all day she had sat with her nose pasted to the pane. It was exciting beyond words to have a family with children moving into that house.</p><p>Hill Street was rightfully named. It ran straight up into a green hill and stopped. The name of the town was Deep Valley, and a town named Deep Valley naturally had plenty of hills. Betsy&#x2019;s house, a small yellow cottage, was the last house on her side of Hill Street, and the rambling white house opposite was the last house on that side. So of course it was very important. And it had been empty ever since Betsy could remember.</p><p>"I hope whoever moves in will have children," Betsy&#x2019;s mother had said.</p><p>"Well, for Pete&#x2019;s sake!" said Betsy&#x2019;s father. "Hill Street is so full of children now that Old Mag has to watch out where she puts her feet down."</p><p>"I know," said Betsy&#x2019;s mother. "There are plenty of children for Julia." (Julia was Betsy&#x2019;s sister, eight years old.) "And there are dozens of babies. But there isn&#x2019;t one little girl just Betsy&#x2019;s age. And that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m hoping will come to the house across the street."</p><p>That was what Betsy hoped, too. And that was what she had been watching for all day as she sat at the dining room window. She was certain there must be such a little girl. There were girls of almost every size and boys to match, milling about the moving dray and in and out of the house. But she wasn&#x2019;t sure. She hadn&#x2019;t absolutely seen one.</p><p>She had watched all day, and now the dining room was getting dark. Julia had stopped practicing her music lesson, and Mrs. Ray had lighted the lamp in the kitchen.</p><p>The March snow lay cold and dirty outside the window, but the wind had died down, and the western sky, behind the house opposite, was stained with red.</p><p>The furniture had all been carried in, and the dray was gone. A light was shining in the house. Suddenly the front door opened, and a little girl ran out. She wore a hood beneath which long red ringlets spattered out above her coat. Her legs in their long black stockings were thin.</p><p>It was Tacy, although Betsy did not know it!</p><p>She ran first to the hitching block, and bounced there on her toes a minute, looking up at the sky and all around. Then she ran up the road to the point where it ended on the hill. Some long-gone person had placed a bench there. It commanded the view down Hill Street. The little girl climbed up on this bench and looked intently into the dusk.</p><p>"I know just how she feels," thought Betsy with a throb. "This is her new home. She wants to see what it&#x2019;s like." She ran to her mother.</p><p>"Mamma!" she cried. "There&#x2019;s the little girl my age. Please let me go out! Just a minute! Please!"</p><p>Mrs. Ray was moved by the entreaty. She looked out at the colored sky.</p><p>"It does seem to be clearing up," she said. "But you could only stay a minute. Do you want to go to the bother of putting on your things . . ."</p><p>"Oh, yes, yes!"</p><p>"Overshoes and mittens and everything?"</p><p>"Yes, really!"</p><p>Betsy flew to the closet, but she could not find her pussy hood. The mittens were twisted on the string inside her coat.</p><p>"Mamma! Help me! Please! She&#x2019;ll be gone."</p><p>"Help her, Julia," called Betsy&#x2019;s mother, and Julia helped, and at last the pussy hood was tied, and the coat buttoned, and the overshoes buckled, and the mittens pulled on.</p><p>Outside the air was fresh and cold. The street lamp had been lighted. It was exciting just to be out at this hour, even without the prospect of meeting the new little girl. But the new little girl still stood on the bench looking down the street.</p><p>Betsy ran toward her. She ran on the sidewalk as far as it went. Then she took to the frozen rutty road, and she had almost reached the bench when the little girl saw her.</p><p>"Hello!" called Betsy. "What&#x2019;s your name?"</p><p>The other child made no answer. She jumped off the bench.</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t go!" cried Betsy. "I&#x2019;m coming."</p><p>But the other child without a word began to run. She brushed past Betsy on her headlong flight down the hill. She ran like a frightened rabbit, and Betsy ran in pursuit.</p><p>"Wait! Wait!" Betsy panted as she ran. But the new child would not stop. On fleet, black-stockinged legs she ran, faster than Betsy could follow.</p><p>"Wait! Wait!" pleaded Betsy but the child did not turn her head. She gained her own lawn, floundered through the snow to her house.</p><p>The entrance to her house was through a storm shed. She ran into this and banged the door. The door had a pane of glass in the front, and through that pane she stared fearfully at Betsy.</p></p><h2>The Salamander Room</h2><p>Illus. in full color.

Rosen describes the Jewish communities in the South and explains their reasons for supporting the South. He relates the experiences of officers, enlisted men, politicians, rabbis and doctors.</p><p>ROBERT N. ROSEN was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. Three of his grandparents were emigrants from the &#34;Pale of Settlement&#34;-Russia, Poland, and Belorus. The other grandparent was born in this country just after her parents arrived from Austria in the 1890s. Rosen attended public schools in Charleston, where his high school history teacher was the Charleston historian Solomon Breibart. He studied at the University of Virginia and at Harvard University, where he received an M.A. in history, as well as at the University of South Carolina Law School. The author of A Short History of Charleston and Confederate Charleston: An Illustrated History of the Place and the People During the Civil War, he has practiced law for twenty-six years in Charleston and is listed in The Best Lawyers in America. Rosen has served on the boards of the South Carolina Historical Society and Historic Charleston Foundation, and he chairs the Arts and History Commission of the City of Charleston.While prominent, largely forgotten Jewish leaders such as Confederate Secretary of State Judah Benjamin and Q.M. Gen. Abraham C. Myers are re-examined in Rosen's account of the Jewish confederacy, the real contribution of this book to Civil War scholarship is its thorough look at the contradictions and ironies implied by the title, and the capsule biographical sketches of quite a few of the 2,000 Jewish men who served in the Confederate army and navy. Looking at the total Southern Jewish population of less than 25,000Abased mainly in the cities of Memphis, Nashville, Mobile and ShreveportARosen concludes that, contrary to the commonly held idea of "old" Jewish families being the mainstay of the contingent, the typical Jewish soldier was a recent immigrant who "enlisted to prove he was a man and a worthy citizen"Aalbeit a citizen sometimes subject to prejudices just as virulent as anti-black racism. In addition to tracking the exploits of many soldiers, Rosen also chronicles the trials and tribulations of Jewish civilians behind the lines and the growth of anti-Semitism as the war progressed. This groundbreaking study is liberally illustrated with photographs and maps, and is written clearly and energetically as a trade book, despite its academic stamp and thoroughness.

She struggled to cope in a world that often made no sense to her, as though her brain had its own operating system. It wasn't until she reached her forties that she found out why: Suddenly and surprisingly, she was diagnosed with autism. <br><br> With a touching and searing honesty, Laura challenges everything we think we know about what it means to be autistic. Married with four children and a successful journalist, Laura examines the ways in which autism has shaped her career, her approach to motherhood, and her closest relationships. Laura's upbeat, witty writing offers new insight into the day-to-day struggles of living with autism, as her extreme attention to sensory detail--a common aspect of her autism--is fascinating to observe through her eyes.<br><br> As Laura grapples with defining her own identity, she also looks at the unique benefits neurodiversity can bring. Lyrical and lush, <i>Odd Girl Out </i>shows how being different doesn't mean being less, and proves that it is never too late for any of us to find our rightful place in the world.<br></p><p>Laura James is an author and journalist and the owner of a communications agency. Her writing has appeared in many national and international newspapers and magazines. She is the mother of four adult children and lives with her husband, their dogs, and a cat in North Norfolk. Since her diagnosis, she has campaigned for autism awareness and acceptance."Profound and essential. Laura James generously allows us to envison the world through her eyes, as the mundane is infused with a synesthetic beauty. A testament to the aspects of autism that are so rarely appreciated." <br><br>--John Elder Robison, author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Look Me in the Eye</i><br> "Too often a woman's success is pegged to the 'posse' with whom she surrounds herself. Laura James, relying on her independent spirit and the differences that set her apart, becomes an accomplished writer and starts a communications agency while raising four children. <i>Odd Girl Out </i>offers a choice of freedom over conformity through the understanding and embracing of one's <i>dis</i>abilities."<br><br> --Eileen Cronin, author of <i>Mermaid: A Memoir of Resilience</i><br> "A masterpiece about autism and a vivid narrative about human frailty and strength."<br><br> --Liane Holliday Willey, author of <i>Pretending to be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome</i> and <i>Asperger Syndrome </i><i>Safety Skills for Asperger Women: How to Save a Perfectly Good Female Life</i><br>"There are so many myths about what it means to be autistic and Laura tells her story beautifully and truthfully.

But it also about the hard decisions faced by those professing a radical faith. For Radosh himself, the crisis came when he concluded in his authoritative book on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg that the couple (in whose behalf he had demonstrated as a boy) had indeed been guilty of spying. Attacked as a traitor, Radosh began to question his political commitments. His disillusionment climaxed in the 1980s when he traveled through Central America as a journalist and historian and ran into his old comrades there still searching for the revolution.</p><p>Ronald Radosh, the scholar who is probably most responsible for showing that Julius Rosenberg was indeed a spy for the Soviet Union, offers this honest memoir of growing up a red-diaper baby in New York and, many years later, falling out of favor with his fellow travelers. Born into a family that was both Jewish and Communist, Radosh spent much of his life orbiting these worlds (especially the latter) as an activist for all sorts of left-wing causes. The FBI even began keeping a file on him. <p> There's a certain amount of score settling on these pages, much of it amusing. What makes <i>Commies</i> fascinating, however, is Radosh's virtual banishment from left-wing politics for publishing <i>The Rosenberg File</i>, a book that definitively showed Julius Rosenberg was not the innocent martyr of liberal mythology but a traitor to his country. Radosh actually started the book believing he could vindicate Rosenberg; through the course of his research, however, he concluded the man was guilty, and set about saying so. This was too much for many of his friends, who soon refused to be seen with him in public. Here is a man who viewed the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 as very possibly a portent of "extreme reaction, if not fascism," suddenly blacklisted by the Left. He became disenchanted with how he had spent his life and "started to question the whole project of the Left." He even suffered professionally: in 1993, Radosh was denied a job in George Washington University's history department. "If I had still been a Communist writing left-wing history, I probably would have breezed in. But faculty members practicing a politically correct version of McCarthyism blackballed me." </p><p> Radosh is not a left-winger who has become a right-winger, like David Horowitz, but he is clearly a person who has had second thoughts about what he once believed. America, he writes, is "a country where I was born but didn't fully discover until middle age." <i>Commies</i> is a valuable document describing radicalism in the 1950s and 1960s from the inside. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>Ronald Radosh's earliest memory is of being trundled off to a May Day demonstration on Fifth Avenue by his communist parents. His boyhood heroes were his uncle Irving Keith (his Party name), who fought in the Spanish Civil War and his cousin Jacob Abrams, a famous Jewish anarchist who lived in "ï¿½xile" in Mexico City and was a friend of Trotsky. <p>Educated at Elisabeth Irwin, New York's famous Little Red School House, and passing his summers in the Catskills at "commie camp," Radosh grew up in the parallel universe of American communism. When he entered the University of Wisconsin in the late 50s he became a founding father of the New Left and was on center stage during the 60s. </p><p>Radosh has been called "the Zelig of the American left-seen everywhere and knowing everyone." Indeed, Commies is filled with memorable portraits of the people he met in his unique journey-schoolmate Mary Travers, later of the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary; Pete Seeger, who taught him the banjo and the Party's musical line; young Bob Dylan who played folk music with him at Radosh's apartment in Madison. Michael Harrington, Tom Hayden, Michael Lerner, William Appleman Williams, Irving Howe, and all the others who made the Movement are also actors in Radosh's drama. </p><p>But if Commies is an intimate social history of the American left over the past half century, it is also a compelling story of a crisis of radical faith. In the early 1980s, Radosh published his groundbreaking work, The Rosenberg File. Having demonstrated at the Rosenbergs' deathwatch as a boy, he began the book (with co-author Joyce Milton) intending to prove the martyrs were innocent. But after examining government files he became convinced of the Rosenbergs' guilt. Attacked as a "traitor" by his former comrades for telling the truth, Radosh began to question his past commitments and the anti Americanism of the movement he had helped lead.

And if that being happens to be <i>you</i>, then the technique called self-compassion can be the greatest of blessings&#x2014;for the compassion you learn to apply to yourself naturally extends to all the other people in your life. With the nine simple mindfulness practices she presents here, Radhule Weininger provides a step-by-step course in self-compassion. Using stories drawn from her own life and those of others she shows that, with the right intention and practice, we can all deepen our capacity to respond skillfully to our own suffering and thus to that of others and our world.</p><p>RADHULE WEININGER, MD, PhD, is a clinical psychologist who first trained as a medical doctor in Germany before migrating to the US more than thirty years ago. She has a clinical practice in Santa Barbara and runs a yearly program at the La Casa de Marie Retreat Centre. She encountered Buddhism in Sri Lanka as a young medical student. Jack Kornfield and Allan Wallace are her mentors. She teaches meditation retreats both in the US and internationally.&#x201c;There is no healing without heartwork, intimately tending to the wounds we&#x2019;ve been avoiding for so long.&nbsp;In this powerful and beautiful book, Radhule Weininger will help you find the courage, pathways, and clarity needed to embrace this life with love.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&#x2014;Tara Brach, PhD,&nbsp;author of <i>Radical Acceptance </i>and<i> True Refuge</i>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In her practice as a psychotherapist and mindfulness meditation teacher, Radhule Weininger guides her patients along the path of personal transformation through the practice of compassion and self-compassion. From the experience of that work comes <i>Heartwork</i>, a book that weaves together Weininger&#x2019;s work and personal journey, wisdom teachings and hands-on exercises. Conveyed through prose that is accessible to readers from a range of spiritual traditions and backgrounds, Weininger presents her insights on the methods she has found useful for identifying the roots of the issues we are all grappling with, as a first step toward addressing them through practice and perseverance. Shining through every chapter is the author&#x2019;s desire to help reduce the suffering that is the common thread connecting humanity.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Victor Chan, coauthor of <i>Wisdom of Forgiveness</i> and <i>Wisdom of Compassion</i> with His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Radhule Weininger offers a tremendous gift in her book, <i>Heartwork</i>, which weaves together the beauty of art, the wisdom of reflection, and the effectiveness of years of practical clinical application.

Her three-part book begins with the rare, poignant journey that led her to these discoveries, and then, after their various forms are carefully set forth, concludes with nine real-life stories of how different people have put them to use.&nbsp;<i>Heartwork</i>&nbsp;helps me to be more present in each moment, more mindful of each encounter.&nbsp;I am especially grateful for the importance given to intention and motive in shaping what we accomplish and whom we become.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Joanna Macy, author of&nbsp;<i>Coming Back to Life&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This book is brimming with compassion!

Heroic - and not so heroic -characters abound: explorers, fur traders, miners, settlers, missionaries, ranchers, Indian chiefs and their tribespeople. Now, when interest in Lewis and Clark and the American Northwest has never been higher, comes the first complete and unabridged paperback edition of Alvin Josephy&#39;s masterwork.</p><p>This is the story of the so-called Inland Empire of the Northwest, that rugged and majestic region bounded east and west by the Cascades and the Rockies, from the time of the great exploration of Lewis and Clark to the tragic defeat of Chief Joseph in 1877. And at the center of this history - perhaps even more relevant today than at the original publication of this classic volume - is the confrontation of the Indian and non-Indian during this nation&#39;s, and this region&#39;s, formative period. Heroic characters and dramatic events abound here. Explorers, fur traders, miners, settlers, missionaries, ranchers, and above all a unique succession of Indian chiefs and their tribespeople bring into focus one of the permanently instructive chapters in the history of the American west.No Bio</p><h2>Comfort and Joy: A Study of the Heidelberg Catechism</h2><p>In 49 brief chapters, Kuyvenhoven explains and illuminates each question and answer of the Heidelberg Catechism in plain language.

A time where family ties and obligations still decide much of life's ebb and flow. A must read for those who love a touch of the unusual.<br><br>Formerly beautiful and at one time betrothed to a fallen soldier, Bonaria Urrai has a long held covenant with the dead. Midwife to the dying, easing their suffering and sometimes ending it, she is revered and feared in equal measure as the village's Accabadora. When Bonaria adopts Maria, the unloved fourth child of a widow, she tries to shield the girl from the truth about her role as an angel of mercy. Moved by the pleas of a young man crippled in an accident, she breaks her golden rule of familial consent, and in the recriminations that follow, Maria rejects her and flees Sardinia for Turin. Adrift in the big city, Maria strives as ever to find love and acceptance, but her efforts are overshadowed by the creeping knowledge of a debt unpaid, of a duty and destiny that must one day be hers.<br><br><i>Accabadora</i> has been awarded seven major literary prizes, including Italy's prestigious Premio Campiello.<br></p><p>Michela Murgia was born in Cabras, Sardinia, in 1972 and has worked as a religious studies teacher, a timeshare saleswoman and an administrator in a power plant. <i>Accabadora</i> establishes her alongside Marcello Fois and Davide Longo at the forefront of a recent renaissance in Italian fiction.<br><br>Silvester Mazzarella is a translator of Italian and Swedish literature. He learned English from his mother, Italian from his father, and Swedish while teaching at the University of Helsinki. He now lives in Canterbury.<br>The bond between an unwanted child and an old woman forms the core of this meditative and moving Italian novel set in 1950s Sardinia. Maria is adopted as a &#x201c;soul child&#x201d; by the village&#x2019;s accabadora, who assists people at their deathbeds. Murgia&#x2019;s third novel traces the unfolding of their relationship and the path of betrayal and reconciliation they follow. The result is a book that is powerful in its overall simplicity, if sometimes employing overwrought language. Murgia has a sharp eye for the villagers&#x2019; foibles and their traditions of gossip and curses. It&#x2019;s a setting ideally suited for the characters facing the drama of life-altering decisions made during everyday moments. Their conversations on topics touching treacherous ground are particularly remarkable for their insight. The result is an eloquent meditation on the role of death in a community. Accabadora, the winner of several Italian literary prizes, is concerned not only with the bonds between life and death, but also with what it costs to sever them. --Bridget Thoreson</p><h2>Trade and Civilisation in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750</h2><p>Before the age of Industrial Revolution, the great Asian civilisations - whether located in the Middle East, India, South-East Asia, or the Far East - constituted areas not only of high culture but also of advanced economic development. They were the First World of human societies. This 1985 book examines one of the driving forces of that historical period: the long chain of oceanic trade which stretched from the South China Sea to the eastern Mediterranean. It also looks at the natural complement of the seaborne commerce, its counterpart in the caravan trade. Its main achievement is to show how socially determined demand derived from cultural habits and interpretations operated through the medium of market forces and relative prices. It points out the unique and limiting features of Asian commercial capitalism, and shows how the contribution of Asian merchants was valued universally, in reality if not legally and formally. Professor Chaudhuri&#39;s book, based on more than twenty years&#39; research and reflection on pre-modern trade and civilisations, was a landmark in the analysis and interpretation of Asia&#39;s historical position and development.</p><p>An analysis of the long chain of oceanic trade, from the South China Sea to the eastern Mediterranean, which dominated seaborne commerce for many centuries up to the Industrial Revolution, reveals the unique features of Asian commercial capitalism as well as the contributions of Asian merchants worldwide.</p><h2>Advertising the American Dream: Making Way for Modernity, 1920-1940</h2><p>It has become impossible to imagine our culture without advertising.

The topics addressed include: searches and seizures, entrapment, confessions, identification procedures, and the exclusionary rules. The Eighth Edition adheres to the practical and flexible approach that has characterized the text from the start. The textual material at the beginning of each chapter and between main opinions is still concise, focused on the foundational essentials that enhance understanding of core concepts. The problems at the end of subsections and chapters, all based on actual federal and state cases, have been updated with some raising novel issues. They serve to expose students to cutting-edge questions. They also furnish opportunities to test comprehension of doctrines by applying them to concrete situations and to refine exam-taking skills. The opinions are limited to those decided by the United States Supreme Court. A core objective of the text is still to present sufficient materials to enable students to gain an appreciation of the richness and complexity of the variety of issues in the field. The Eighth Edition includes edited versions of the most significant opinions handed down since the Seventh Edition was published and incorporates notes that capture the essence of other important rulings. A few significant opinions have been supplanted and now are the subject of summarizing notes. One brief foundational chapter which addressed the right to assistance of counsel at trial has been omitted. The foundation is now provided by a substantial note that introduces the following chapter.</p><p>James J. Tomkovicz is Professor of Law at University of Iowa College of Law. The late Welsh S.

Yet the works of the writers who founded and nurtured the black women's literary tradition--nineteenth-century Afro-American women--have remained buried in research libraries or in expensive hard-to-find reprints, often inaccessible to twentieth-century readers.<br> Oxford University Press, in collaboration with the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a research unit of The New York Public Library, rescued the voice of an entire segment of the black tradition by offering thirty volumes of these compelling and rare works of fiction, poetry, autobiography, biography, essays, and journalism. Responding to the wide recognition this series has received, Oxford now presents four of these volumes in paperback. Each book contains an introduction written by an expert in the field, as well as an overview by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the General Editor.<br> Individually, each of these four works now in paperback--including <em>The Journals of Charlotte Forten Grimkï¿½</em>, Elizabeth Keckley's <em>Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House</em>, <em>Six Women's Slave Narratives</em>, and <em>The Collected Works of Phillis Wheatley</em>--stands as a unique literary contribution in its own right. Collectively providing a rich sampling of the range of works written by black women over the course of more than a century, they pay tribute (now long overdue) to an extraordinary and influential group of Afro-American women. These new editions will enable teachers, students, and general readers of American literature, history, Afro-American culture, and women's studies to hear at last, and learn from, the lost voice of the nineteenth-century black woman writer.<br></p><p><br><strong>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</strong> is Chairman of the Department of Afro-American Studies and W.E.B.

The author explores the ways that feminist movements emerged from the Civil Rights/ Black Liberation movement, the Chicano movement, and the white left, and the processes that went into political decisions made by feminists to organize autonomously, and in their own racial/ethnic organizations. The book traces the effects that inequality had on the possibilities for feminist unity; the way that loyalties to the &#34;men left behind&#34; impacted feminist organizing, particularly by Black and Chicana feminists; and explores how ideas common throughout the left at the time shaped feminist organizing."Her capacity to problematize widely accepted approaches to the study of the second wave enables us to see that field anew."

While the movement embraced such diverse artists as E. L. Kirchner, Wassily Kandinsky, Kï¿½the Kollwitz, and George Grosz, all the participants shared an almost messianic belief in the power of art to change society.

Ronald Hutton draws upon a wealth of new data, much of it archaeological, that has transformed interpretation over the past decade. Giving more or less equal weight to all periods, from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages, he examines a fascinating range of evidence for Celtic and Romano-British paganism, from burial sites, cairns, megaliths and causeways, to carvings, figurines, jewellery, weapons, votive objects, literary texts and folklore.</p><p><b>Ronald Hutton</b> was educated at Cambridge and then at Oxford, where he held a fellowship at Magdalen College. In 1981, he moved to the University of Bristol, where he is now Reader in British History. He is a historian of wide interests ranging from political affairs and popular culture to topics covering the whole of the British Isles. This is his fifth book.Hutton (British history, Bristol Univ.) offers an excellent, up-to-date compendium on British pagan religions based primarily upon recent archaeological findings. Various pre-Christian religions in the British Isles throughout history are discussed beginning as far back as 30,000 B.C., when carvings on portable objects first seem to have appeared. Hutton continues coverage through the Roman influence and the eventual advance of Christianity, which coincided with the disappearance of the pagan religions from the British Isles. He closes with a discussion of the remaining influences and traces of the early pagan religions. Hutton has contributed a well-documented resource which has popular interest.

This new edition surveys the field today. It incorporates all of the latest research findings and grounds economic inquiry in a more robust understanding of human needs and behavior. Humans and ecological systems, it argues, are inextricably bound together in complex and long-misunderstood ways. &nbsp;According to ecological economists, conventional economics does not reflect adequately the value of essential factors like clean air and water, species diversity, and social and generational equity. By excluding biophysical and social systems from their analyses, many conventional economists have overlooked problems of the increasing scale of human impacts and the inequitable distribution of resources. &nbsp;This introductory-level textbook is designed specifically to address this significant flaw in economic thought. The book describes a relatively new &#x201c;transdiscipline&#x201d; that incorporates insights from the biological, physical, and social sciences. It provides students with a foundation in traditional neoclassical economic thought, but places that foundation within an interdisciplinary framework that embraces the linkages among economic growth, environmental degradation, and social inequity. In doing so, it presents a revolutionary way of viewing the world.&nbsp;The second edition of <i>Ecological Economics</i> provides a clear, readable, and easy-to-understand overview of a field of study that continues to grow in importance. It remains the only stand-alone textbook that offers a complete explanation of theory and practice in the discipline.<br></p><p>Herman E. Daly is professor at the University of Maryland, School of Public Affairs. He is a cofounder of Ecological Economics, the leading journal in the discipline, and recipient of the Right Livelihood Award, also known as the &#x201c;alternative Nobel Prize.&#x201d; &nbsp;Joshua Farley is a professor of community development and applied economics and assistant research professor at the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics at the University of Vermont."As ecological economics builds upon neoclassical economics, however, this single volume treatment of the relatively new field by Daley (emeritus, U. of Maryland) and Farley (U. of Vermont) goes beyond merely critiquing neoclassical models and instead incorporates them into the main body of the text, thus providing an introduction to many of the main concepts and issues found in standard texts on macroeconomics and microeconomics while also addressing the disciplinary and policy implications of the natural limits to growth." <br> (<i>Reference &amp; Research Book News</i>)</p><h2>Clinical Blood Gases</h2><p>This text provides a thorough resource on arterial blood gases, covering the full scope of applications.

But most of them have received little or no instruction on doing it well. This book shows them how in ways no other book does. It combines the practical guidance and theoretical understanding students need to complete their theses or dissertations with maximum insight and minimum stress. Drawing on her extensive research and experience advising hundreds of graduate students, Dr. Irene Clark presents a solid overview of the writing process. Clark shows how to apply innovative theories of process and genre and understand the writing process for what it is: your entrance into a conversation with the scholarly community that will determine your success or failure. This book offers useful strategies for each phase of the process, from choosing advisors and identifying topics through writing, revision, and review.

Clark</b> is Professor of English and Director of Composition at California State University Northridge, where she is also in charge of the Master&#x2019;s degree in Rhetoric and Composition option. She has published in <i>College Composition and Communication, Profession, Composition Forum, </i>and <i>The Writing Center Journal, </i>and has written several books that focus on writing and the teaching of writing, including <i>Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing, Writing in the Center, </i>and <i>The Genre of Argument.</i> </p>Preface <p><b>Preface</b></p> <p> <i>Writing the Successful Thesis and Dissertation: Entering the Conversation</i> is intended to help graduate students complete theses or dissertations by providing both theoretical understanding and practical instruction. It<i> </i>derives from my experience as a Writing Center director, working with students from a variety of disciplines; from my role as a thesis advisor to students in the English department at my own university; and from workshops I have given in Holland to graduate students in the social sciences. It is also based on research I have conducted with students and faculty at several universities that has helped me develop strategies that students find helpful. Its goal is to help you write your thesis or dissertation with maximum insight and minimum stress. </p> <p>Theoretically, this book explains how theories of process and genre can provide important insights into writing a thesis or dissertation in terms of function and form. Practically, it offers suggestions for undertaking the various components of the process: reading and engaging critically with complex texts, discovering ideas, writing a compelling proposal, developing and revising drafts, constructing the review of the literature, working with tables and graphs, and using various cuing and organizational strategies to maintain manageability and coherence. It also discusses administrative issues, such as selecting and working with an advisor, maneuvering through graduate committees, and avoiding inadvertent plagiarism. </p> <p>The "process" approach to composition on which this book is based has become common in the study and teaching of undergraduate writing, particularly in the United States. Whereas in the past writing was "assigned" and students were expected to produce a text or "product" that was given a grade, the process approach recognizes an important truism about writing: It does not occur effortlessly, and few, if any, writers produce an excellent text without a great deal of thinking, drafting, rewriting, rethinking, redrafting, and so on. Yet theses and dissertation advisors often do not use a process approach when working with graduate students. Professors who serve as advisors may have little difficulty identifying (or complaining about) inadequacies in their students' theses or dissertations, but they sometimes do not define rhetorical goals and genre requirements, perhaps because they have not consciously articulated these goals and requirements for themselves or because they feel that they shouldn't have to do so. Given this approach, students are left pretty much on their own to figure out what is expected of them.</p> <p>Most graduate students, however, cannot "intuit" what is expected in a thesis or dissertation, and because they worry about appearing inadequate, they may ask few questions and embark on the process without a clear sense of purpose. Some are non-native speakers of English, grappling with unfamiliar terminology and language structures. Many have little idea of what is considered "knowledge" in their field, have only a general notion of a topic they may like to explore, are unaware of what is involved in transforming a topic into a workable research question, and don't know what sort of proposal is likely to be successful. Thesis anxiety causes some to avoid writing as long as possible, engaging in extensive reading and note-taking as an avoidance strategy or procrastinating in other ways. Some develop writing blocks, even if they have never had difficulty writing at other times.</p> <p>Moreover, even thesis or dissertation advisors with the best of intentions have only limited time to devote to graduate students' writing needs; therefore, it is in your best interest to study the process on your own.<i> Writing the Successful Thesis and Dissertation: Entering the Conversation </i>can serve as your guide, helping you gain insight into what a thesis or dissertation is intended to <i>do</i> and become aware of how its form derives from its <i>function</i>. When you understand the <i>genre</i> of the thesis or dissertation and learn strategies to help you write more successfully, you will become a better writer and scholar who is able to enter the scholarly community and participate meaningfully in its conversations.</p> <br> <p>ï¿½ Copyright Pearson Education.

Ford shows us in <i>The Quantum World</i>, the laws governing the very small and the very swift defy common sense and stretch our minds to the limit. Drawing on a deep familiarity with the discoveries of the twentieth century, Ford gives an appealing account of quantum physics that will help the serious reader make sense of a science that, for all its successes, remains mysterious. In order to make the book even more suitable for classroom use, the author, assisted by Diane Goldstein, has included a new section of Quantum Questions at the back of the book. A separate answer manual to these 300+ questions is available; visit <i>The Quantum World</i> website for ordering information.</p><p>There is also a cloth edition of this book, which does not include the "Quantum Questions" included in this paperback edition.</p></p><p>Kenneth W. Ford, retired director of the American Institute of Physics, has taught at university and high-school levels.

But behind both works lay the assumption that the philosophy of language is in the end a branch of the philosophy of the mind: speech acts are forms of human action and represent just one example of the mind&#39;s capacity to relate the human organism to the world. The present book is concerned with these biologically fundamental capacities, and, though third in the sequence, in effect it provides the philosophical foundations for the other two. Intentionality is taken to be the crucial mental phenomenon, and its analysis involves wide-ranging discussions of perception, action, causation, meaning, and reference. In all these areas John Searle has original and stimulating views. He ends with a resolution of the &#39;mind-body&#39; problem.</p><p>Although third in sequence, this work provides the philosophical foundations for the author&#39;s Speech Acts (1969) and Expression and Meaning (1979) in which a highly original and influential approach to the study of language is developed.'The strengths of the book lie in its vigor and general clarity, and in the stimulating discussions of the pre-intentional background necessary to the existence of intentional states and of the intentions of a communicator. [Searle's] sharp statement of the structural parallels between action and perception is possibly the best introduction to that phenomenon.' Philosophical Review<br><br>'The scope and consistency of his attempt to explain the Philosophy of Language as part of the Philosophy of the Mind is truly impressive.'

Republicans in Congress threatened to shut down the government and force a U.S. debt default. Tea Party activists mounted primary challenges against Republican officeholders who appeared to exhibit too much pragmatism or independence. Moderation and compromise were dirty words in the Republican presidential debates. The GOP, it seemed, had suddenly become a party of ideological purity.<br><br>Except this development is not new at all. In <em>Rule and Ruin</em>, Geoffrey Kabaservice reveals that the moderate Republicans' downfall began not with the rise of the Tea Party but about the time of President Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address. Even in the 1960s, when left-wing radicalism and right-wing backlash commanded headlines, Republican moderates and progressives formed a powerful movement, supporting pro-civil rights politicians like Nelson Rockefeller and William Scranton, battling big-government liberals and conservative extremists alike. But the Republican civil war ended with the overthrow of the moderate ideas, heroes, and causes that had comprised the core of the GOP since its formation. In hindsight, it is today's conservatives who are "Republicans in Name Only."<br><br>Writing with passionate sympathy for a bygone tradition of moderation, Kabaservice recaptures a time when fiscal restraint was matched with social engagement; when a cohort of leading Republicans opposed the Vietnam war; when George Romney--father of Mitt Romney--conducted a nationwide tour of American poverty, from Appalachia to Watts, calling on society to "listen to the voices from the ghetto." Rule and Ruin is an epic, deeply researched history that reorients our understanding of our political past and present.<br><br>Today, following the Republicans' loss of the popular vote in five of the last six presidential contests, moderates remain marginalized in the GOP and progressives are all but nonexistent. In this insightful and elegantly argued book, Kabaservice contends that their decline has left Republicans less capable of governing responsibly, with dire consequences for all Americans. He has added a new afterword that considers the fallout from the 2012 elections.<br></p><p><br><strong>Geoffrey Kabaservice</strong> is the author of the National Book Award-nominated <em>The Guardians: Kingman Brewster, His Circle, and the Rise of the Liberal Establishment</em>. He has written for numerous national publications and has been an assistant professor of history at Yale University. He lives outside Washington, DC.<br><br>"In <em>Rule and Ruin</em>, his wonderfully detailed new history of moderate Republicanism, Geoffrey Kabaservice makes a strong case that moderate Republicanism was hardier than we remember." --Timothy Noah, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"The good guys lost; the bad guys won. That's the story Kabaservice sets out to tell in <em>Rule and Ruin</em>. He tells it in strong and engaging prose, often with a literary flair." --<em>The National Interest</em> <br><p></p><br>"Kabaservice is a wonderfully straightforward historian who does not layer on a lot of interpretive gloss...<em>Rule and Ruin</em> is a wonderful reminder of what was once -- not very long ago -- a vital tradition in American politics." --<em>The New Republic</em> <br><p></p><br>"An audacious and important history that rediscovers a great political tradition at exactly the moment when it is again needed most." --David Frum, author of <em>Comeback: Conservatism that Can Win Again</em> <br><p></p><br>"The radical turn of the Republican Party into a voice of right-wing extremism is one of the major themes of modern American political history. <em>Rule and Ruin</em> tells the whole story in stunning detail, and in prose that is as balanced as it is lucid. No study of our recent politics could possibly be more timely on the eve of the 2012 elections." --Sean Wilentz, Princeton University, author of <em>The Age of Reagan</em> <br><p></p><br>"Meticulously researched and compellingly written, <em>Rule and Ruin</em> is more than an account of the demise of moderate Republicans; it is a penetrating history of the modern Republican Party over the past half century. This is an exceptional book, and must reading for anyone who will follow with interest (or dread) the Republican race to a presidential nomination in 2012." --Norman J. Ornstein, Resident Scholar, The American Enterprise Institute <br><p></p><br>"In this timely work, Geoffrey Kabaservice successfully combines thorough historical research and a gripping narrative. The result is a comprehensive account of an ideological and political contest which, played out over half a century, has had a profound influence on the Republican Party and modern American politics." --Strobe Talbott, President, Brookings Institution <br><p></p><br>"Kabaservice's book is a painstaking and well-argued attempt to resurrect the losers in the GOP's fratricidal war, the liberal and moderate Republicans, including many from the northeastern states where today their influence still lingers." --Sam Tanenhaus, <em>The New York Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"Kabaservice ably narrates the Republican Party's fifty-year conversion from a diverse political organization into an exclusively conservative 'ideological vehicle.'...Kabaservice is <br>as moderate as his subject matter; he resists proposing an implausibly easy solution. He believes that third-party projects are likely "foredoomed to failure," and redistricting reforms will be "a slow process" at best." --<em>Commonwealth</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Student Selected Solutions Manual for Chemistry: Structure and Properties</h2><p><p>The selected solution manual for students contains complete, step-by-step solutions to selected odd-numbered end-of- chapter problems.</p> <br></p><p></p><h2>Elementary Theory of Analytic Functions of One or Several Complex Variables (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>Noted mathematician offers basic treatment of theory of analytic functions of a complex variable, touching on analytic functions of several real or complex variables as well as the existence theorem for solutions of differential systems where data is analytic.

Yet how were the lives of the ordinary German people of the 1930s and '40s affected by the politics of Hitler and his followers? Looking beyond the catalog of events, this intriguing book reveals that daily German life involved a complex mixture of bribery and terror; of fear and concessions; of barbarism and appeals to conventional moral values employed by the Nazis to maintain their grip on society. Eight leading historians present essays that shed fresh light on topics as familiar as the role of political violence in Nazi seizure of power and the German view of Hitler himself. It also focuses on lesser-known aspects of life in the Third Reich, such as village life, the treatment of "social outcasts," and the Germans' own retrospective view of this period of their history.<br></p><p>The Third Reich, a regime which instigated the most destructive war in modern history, still evokes fascination and horror today.

Feminist theories are viewed through the critical intersections of race, class, sexuality, age, and ability, and are embedded in the experiences of everyday life, allowing Bromley to engage readers in doing theory, in making sense of concepts like "power" and "privilege," and in effecting social change.

Those who are mostly familiar with stereotypes of feminism will begin to understand how these false depictions came to be mainstream through Bromley's overview. <em>Feminisms Matter</em> provides readers with an explanation as to how their existing politics may already align with feminist theories. Rather than teaching feminism from a linear "movement" perspective, Bromley sees theory and practice as inseparable&#x2014;an approach to feminism that acknowledges lived reality. (<em>Shameless Magazine</em>)<br><br>Bromley has done an exceptional job of rendering dense and complex material accessible to readers who are interested in understanding current and historical feminisms and will aid educators in helping students connect theories to praxis.

(<em>Affilia</em>)</p><h2>Crossing Hitler: The Man Who Put the Nazis on the Witness Stand</h2><p>During a 1931 trial of four Nazi stormtroopers, known as the Eden Dance Palace trial, Hans Litten grilled Hitler in a brilliant and merciless three-hour cross-examination, forcing him into multiple contradictions and evasions and finally reducing him to helpless and humiliating rage (the transcription of Hitler's full testimony is included.) At the time, Hitler was still trying to prove his embrace of legal methods, and distancing himself from his stormtroopers. The courageous Litten revealed his true intentions, and in the process, posed a real threat to Nazi ambition.<br> When the Nazis seized power two years after the trial, friends and family urged Litten to flee the country. He stayed and was sent to the concentration camps, where he worked on translations of medieval German poetry, shared the money and food he was sent by his wealthy family, and taught working-class inmates about art and literature. When Jewish prisoners at Dachau were locked in their barracks for weeks at a time, Litten kept them sane by reciting great works from memory. After five years of torture and hard labor-and a daring escape that failed-Litten gave up hope of survival. His story was ultimately tragic but, as Benjamin Hett writes in this gripping narrative, it is also redemptive. "It is a story of human nobility in the face of barbarism."<br> The first full-length biography of Litten, the book also explores the turbulent years of the Weimar Republic and the terror of Nazi rule in Germany after 1933.

Moreover, they provide a wonderful lens on the experiences of immigrants and minorities in the United States more generally, both historically and today. In this timely new text, Pawan Dhingra and Robyn Magalit Rodriguez critically examine key sociological topics through the experiences of Asian Americans, including social hierarchies (of race, gender, and sexuality), work, education, family, culture, identity, media, pan-ethnicity, social movements, and politics. <br><br>With vivid examples and lucid discussion of a broad range of theories, the authors demonstrate the contributions of the discipline of sociology to understanding Asian Americans, and vice versa. In addition, this text takes students beyond the boundaries of the United States to cultivate a comparative and global understanding of the Asian experience, as it has become increasingly transnational and diasporic.<br><br>Bridging sociology and the growing interdisciplinary field of Asian American studies, and uniquely placing them in dialogue with one another, this engaging text will be welcome in undergraduate and graduate sociology courses such as race and ethnic relations, immigration, and social stratification, as well as on ethnic studies courses more broadly.</p><p><p><b>Pawan Dhingra</b> is Professor and Chair of Sociology and Professor of American Studies at Tufts University. <br><br><b>Robyn Magalit Rodriguez</b> is Associate Professor of Asian American Studies at the University of California, Davis.</p><p>"[Dhingra &amp; Rodriguez] succinctly but compellingly present arguments and evidence from different sociological and interdisciplinary approaches, from assimilationist perspectives to critical race theory.

Townsend&#39;s new text shuns the historical ordering that characterizes so-called Modern Physics textbooks and applies a truly modern approach to this subject, starting instead with contemporary single-photon and single-atom interference experiments. The text progresses naturally from a thorough introduction to wave mechanics through applications of quantum mechanics to solid-state, nuclear, and particle physics, thereby including most of the topics normally presented in a Modern Physics course. Examples of topics include blackbody radiation, Bose-Einstein condensation, the band-structure of solids and the silicon revolution, the curve of binding energy and nuclear fission and fusion, and the Standard Model of particle physics. Students can see in quantum mechanics a common thread that ties these topics into a coherent picture of how the world works, a picture that gives students confidence that quantum mechanics really works, too. The book also includes a chapter-length appendix on special relativity for the benefit of students who have not had a previous exposure to this subject. Also available is an accompanying, detailed Instructor&#39;s Solutions Manual for adopting professors.</p><p>John S. Townsend is the Susan and Bruce Worster Professor of Physics at Harvey Mudd College, the science and engineering college of the Claremont Colleges. He received his B.S. from Duke University, his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, and was a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow.&nbsp;He has been a visiting professor at Caltech, the University of Southampton in England, Duke University and Swarthmore College, and he was a Science Fellow at the Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford University. He loves teaching, especially quantum physics. Townsend is also the author of A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics.When I read this book I immediately adopted it for my sophomore Modern Physics class. This is the best introduction to quantum mechanics available. --B. Paul Padley, Rice University<br><br>Townsend has written an excellent book that someone needed to write for the Modern Physics textbook market. He has given it the same care that he gave to his excellent quantum mechanics book. --Jeff Dunham, Middlebury College</p><h2>Conflict and Compromise: The Political Economy of Slavery, Emancipation and the American Civil War</h2><p>No series of events had a more dramatic impact on the course of American history than the Civil War and the emancipation of four million slaves. This book examines the economic and political factors that led to the attempt by Southerners to dissolve the Union in 1860 and the equally determined effort of Northerners to preserve it. A central thesis of the book is that slavery not only &#34;caused&#34; the Civil War by producing tensions that could not be resolved by compromise; the slave system also played a crucial role in the outcome of the war by crippling the Southern war effort at the same time that emancipation became a unifying cause for the North. The author looks at a century of sectional conflict over slavery and reveals a great irony of the American Civil War. The South suffered a bitter defeat in a war to protect the institution of slavery, even though it is likely that the Constitution of the United States offered the best protection for a slave system. And, despite the abolition of slavery in the United States, equality for Black Americans remained a distant dream.</p><p>An examination of the economic and political factors that led to the attempt by Southerners to dissolve the Union in 1860 and the equally determined effort of Northerners to preserve it.No series of events has had a more dramatic impact on the course of American history than the Civil War and the emancipation of four million black slaves.

"Learned helplessness" refers to the problems that arise in the wake of uncontrollability. First described in the 1960s among laboratory animals, learned helplessness has since been applied to a variety of human problems entailing inappropriate passivity and demoralization. While learned helplessness is best known as an explanation of depression, studies with both people and animals have mapped out the cognitive and biological aspects. The present volume, written by some of the most widely recognized leaders in the field, summarizes and integrates the theory, research, and application of learned helplessness. Each line of work is evaluated critically in terms of what is and is not known, and future directions are sketched. More generally, psychiatrists and psychologists in various specialties will be interested in the book's argument that a theory emphasizing personal control is of particular interest in the here and now, as individuality and control are such salient cultural topics.<br></p><p>Christopher Petersen is at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Could computers (in principle) be made to model every aspect of the mind, including logic, language, and emotion? This interdisciplinary collection of classical and contemporary readings provides a clear and comprehensive guide to the many hotly-debated philosophical issues at the heart of artificial intelligence. The editor includes an informative introduction and reading list.<br></p><p>A collection of classic articles from the field of artificial intelligence (AI), <i>The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence</i> would be a good complement to an introductory textbook on AI fundamentals. The back cover of the book states that the material is intended for the university student or general reader, but don't be fooled. Unless you are a student in a supportive class setting or a general reader who happens to have a degree in engineering, you are likely to find the content difficult. The first chapter, for example, assumes knowledge of calculus. However, if you have the right preparation, you'll be treated to fifteen important papers in AI--including Alan Turing's <i>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</i> article, which proposed the now well-known Turing test for determining whether a machine is intelligent.This volume contains classical and contemporary essays which explore the philosophical foundations of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. They illustrate objections raised by critics outside the field, and radical controversies within it.</p><h2>L&#39;Essentiel de la Grammaire Francaise (French Edition)</h2><p><p>A clear and concise review of the essentials of french grammar, the workbook compliments the main text. </p></p><p>L&#39;Essentiel is a comprehensive French grammar review classic.

Readers will benefit from the author's twenty-five years of study and experience with dogs as a behavioral consultant and trainer.<br> The vast majority of dogs exhibit at least one undesirable habit. Most of these problems are responsive to remedial training and brief counseling. However, some behavior problems are the result of a more complex etiology involving adverse emotional influences, cognitive disturbances, or pervasive behavioral disorganization. If not properly identified and treated, such problems may lead to the dog being removed from the home or euthanized.<br> <p>Volume 2 of Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training explores the collective causes underlying the development of serous adjustment problems in dogs. Coupled with Volume 1: Adaptation and Learning, Volume 2 provides a comprehensive theoretical and practical framework for understanding the development and treatment of behavior problems.<br> The focus of Volume 2 is to present and evaluate the relevant applied and scientific literature, with the goals of clarifying what is known about the etiology of dog behavior problems and highlighting what yet remains to be learned.

Nearly one in three women in the United States will experience intimate violence in her lifetime. And while intimate violence affects relationships across the sexuality and gender spectrums, the likelihood of isolation and irreparable harm, including death, is even greater within LGBTQI communities. To effectively resist violence out there--in the prison system, on militarized borders, or in other clear encounters with "the system"--we must challenge how it is reproduced right where we live. It's one thing when the perpetrator is the police, the state, or someone we don't know. It's quite another when that person is someone we call a friend, lover, and trusted ally. <p> Based on the popular zine that had reviewers and fans alike demanding more, <i>The Revolution Starts at Home</i> finally breaks the dangerous silence surrounding the "open secret" of intimate violence--by and toward caretakers, in romantic partnerships, and in friendships--within social justice movements. This watershed collection compiles stories and strategies from survivors and their allies, documenting a decade of community accountability work and delving into the nitty-gritty of creating safety from abuse without relying on the prison industrial complex. </p><p> Fearless, tough-minded, and ultimately loving, <i>The Revolution Starts at Home offers life-saving alternatives for ensuring survivor safety while building a road toward a revolution where no one is left behind.</i></p><br>Ching-In Chen is the author of <i>The Heart's Traffic</i>, and a genderqueer and multi-genre writer.

Born in 1098 in Bockelheim on the Nahe River, Hildegard had her first vision at the age of six, a phenomenon she would continue to experience the rest of her life. At the behest of the archbishop of Mainz, Hildegard set upon recording her visions in writing. Her writings soon propelled her from Benedictine abbess to celebrity as determined reformer, castigating seer, theoretical musician, patient adviser, and exorcist. A woman of extraordinarily energetic and independent mind, Hildegard wrote profusely throughout her life as a prophet, a poet, a musical composer, a dramatist, a physician, and a political moralist. Indeed, her musical compositions have reached new heights in popularity, highlighting the revival of Gregorian chant currently sweeping the United States. Hildegard communicated with popes and princes, with people of both influence and humble status, always standing above the corruption, misery, and ruin--both spiritual and temporal--of the twelfth century. <br> The second of Hildegard's three books of visions, <em>The Book of the Rewards of Life (Liber Vitae Meritorum)</em> is a study of the human weaknesses that separates us from God. Written with remarkable visual clarity, it stands as one the most subtle and fascinating works ever written on the relationship of various sins to their corresponding virtues. Divided into six parts, this compelling work focuses on our moral flaws, seemingly inherent in human consciousness, and the role of repentance and the virtues in re-establishing our union with God.

A successful fiction writer, Pollack had grown up in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s dreaming of a career as a theoretical astrophysicist. Denied the chance to take advanced courses in science and math, she nonetheless made her way to Yale. There, despite finding herself far behind the men in her classes, she went on to graduate summa cum laude, with honors, as one of the university&#x2019;s first two women to earn a bachelor of science degree in physics. And yet, isolated, lacking in confidence, starved for encouragement, she abandoned her ambition to become a physicist.<br><br>Years later, spurred by the suggestion that innate differences in scientific and mathematical aptitude might account for the dearth of tenured female faculty at Summer&#x2019;s institution, Pollack thought back on her own experiences and wondered what, if anything, had changed in the intervening decades.<br><br> Based on six years interviewing her former teachers and classmates, as well as dozens of other women who had dropped out before completing their degrees in science or found their careers less rewarding than they had hoped, <i>The Only Woman in the Room</i> is a bracingly honest, no-holds-barred examination of the social, interpersonal, and institutional barriers confronting women&#x2014;and minorities&#x2014;in the STEM fields. This frankly personal and informed book reflects on women&#x2019;s experiences in a way that simple data can&#x2019;t, documenting not only the more blatant bias of another era but all the subtle disincentives women in the sciences still face.<br><br><i>The Only Woman in the Room</i> shows us the struggles women in the sciences have been hesitant to admit, and provides hope for changing attitudes and behaviors in ways that could bring far more women into fields in which even today they remain seriously underrepresented.<br><br><b>Named one of the notable nonfiction books of 2015 by <i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p><b>Eileen Pollack</b> is the author of the novels <i>Breaking and Entering</i> (a <i>New York Times</i> Editor&#x2019;s Choice selection) and <i>Paradise, New York</i>, as well as two collections of short fiction, an award-winning book of nonfiction, and two creative-nonfiction textbooks. Her work has appeared in <i>Best American Essays</i> and <i>Best American Short Stories</i>. She is a professor on the faculty of the Helen Zell MFA Program in Creative Writing at the University of Michigan. She divides her time between Manhattan and Ann Arbor, Michigan.Even in the 1970s, the sexism I experienced was rarely obvious. I grew up in a privileged, loving home with few barriers that might prevent a bright, confident young woman from succeeding in whatever field she took it in her head to enter. All this led me to suspect that the reasons for the scarcity of female physicists must be subtle, and those reasons must lie buried in the psyches of the women who loved science and math but never completed their degrees or, like me, earned their degrees but left their fields. . . . By trying to understand why I didn&#x2019;t become a physicist, I hoped to gain insights into why so many young women still fail to go on in science and math in the numbers their presence in high school classrooms and their scores on standardized tests <br> predict.<br> &nbsp;<br> What I discovered shocked me. Although more young women major in physics at Yale than when I attended school there, those young women told me stories of the sexism they had encountered in junior high and high school that seemed even more troubling than what I had experienced: complaints about being belittled and teased by their classmates and teachers, worries about being perceived as unfeminine or uncool. . . . The same forces that caused me to feel isolated and unsure of myself at Yale continue to hem in young women today, acting like an invisible electrified field to discourage all but the thickest skinned from following their passion for science, a phenomenon that turns out to be less true in other countries, where women are perceived as being equally capable in science and math as men.</p><h2>Leviathan (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Leviathan is both a magnificent literary achievement and the greatest work of political philosophy in the English language.

Five years later he wrote, &#39;the desire to be buried next her is as strong upon me now ... and I know (for I don&#39;t think there ever was love like that I bear her) that it will never diminish.&#39;</p><p>The sound of Little Nell clattering hurriedly over cobblestones immediately sets the stage by bringing to mind the narrow and dangerous streets of Victorian London. No fewer than 20 performers are called upon to conjure up the Dickensian world of wanderers, ne'er-do-wells, con artists, and kind Samaritans--and each performance is excellent. Tom Courtenay plays the sadistic Quilp, "the ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a penny" with magnificent sarcastic glee, and Teresa Gallagher's silvery, childlike voice is ideally suited for the role of the angelic Little Nell.<p> Nell is on her way home to the dusty shop where she and her grandfather live a rather mysterious life. The old man disappears every night--visiting gambling dens with the naive hope of winning a fortune. Instead he sinks deeper and deeper into debt. Enter Daniel Quilp, moneylender, who becomes furious upon learning that the grandfather is a pauper and will never be able to repay his tremendous debt. Quilp seizes the curiosity shop and begins making lecherous overtures to Nell, so she and her grandfather steal away one morning to seek their fortunes elsewhere. But the demonic dwarf is never far behind.</p><p> Sound effects are employed judiciously and serve mainly as a springboard for the listener's imagination. The sound of a crying baby is enough to convey the image of crowded lodgings and genteel Victorian poverty, while raucous laughter and high-pitched squawks evoke the barely controlled chaos of an outdoor Punch and Judy show. The dramatization pares Dickens's weighty novel down to two and one-half hours, but does so skillfully, retaining Dickens's wit, marvelous dialogue, and delightful characterizations.

Is it not just, he reasons, for a man of genius to commit such a crime, to transgress moral law&#x2014;if it will ultimately benefit humanity? So begins one of the greatest novels ever written: a powerful psychological study, a terrifying murder mystery, a fascinating detective thriller infused with philosophical, religious and social commentary. Raskolnikov, an impoverished student living in a garret in the gloomy slums of St. Petersburg, carries out his grotesque scheme and plunges into a hell of persecution, madness and terror.&nbsp;<i>Crime and Punishment</i>&nbsp;takes the reader on a journey into the darkest recesses of the criminal and depraved mind, and exposes the soul of a man possessed by both good and evil . . . a man who cannot escape his own conscience.</p><p>CRIME AND PUNISHMENT <br>By Fyodor Dostoevsky <br>Translated By Constance Garnett"Dostoevsky conceived the idea of Crime and Punishment in the summer of 1865, having lost all his money at the casino, unable to pay his bill or afford proper meals. At the time the author owed large sums of money to creditors, and he was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early 1864. Projected under the title The Drunkards, it was to deal "with the present question of drunkness ... [in] all its ramifications, especially the picture of a family and the bringing up of children in these circumstance, etc., etc." Once Dostoevsky conceived Raskolnikov and his crime, now inspired by the case of Pierre FranÃ§ois Lacenaire, this theme became ancillary, centering on the story of the Marmeladov family. <p>Dostoevsky offered his story or novella (at the time Dostoevsky was not thinking of a novel) to the publisher Mikhail Katkov. His monthly journal, The Russian Messenger, was a prestigious publication of its kind, and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy, but Dostoevsky, having carried on quite bruising polemics with Katkov in early 1860s, had never published anything in its pages. Dostoevsky turned as a last resort to Katkov, and asked for an advance on a proposed contribution after all other appeals elsewhere failed. In a letter to Katkov written in September 1865, Dostoevsky explained to him that the work was to be about a young man who yields to "certain strange, 'unfinished' ideas, yes floating in the air"; he had thus embarked on his plan to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the "radical" ideology. In letters written in November 1865 an important conceptual change occurred: the "story" has become a "novel", and from here on all references to Crime and Punishment are to a novel. </p><p>Dostoevsky had to race against time, in order to finish on time both The Gambler and Crime and Punishment. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who would soon become his second wife, was a great help for Dostoevsky during this difficult task. The first part of Crime and Punishment appeared in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger, and the last one was published in December 1866." - Wikipedia</p></p><h2>Out of Now, updated edition: The Lifeworks of Tehching Hsieh (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>Now in paperback, an updated edition of a visually stunning documentary record and critical account of Tehching Hsieh's epic performance works.</b></p><p>In the vibrant downtown Manhattan art scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Taiwanese-American artist Tehching Hsieh made a series of extraordinary performance art works. Between September 1978 and July 1986, Hsieh realized five separate one-year-long performance pieces in which he conformed to simple but highly restrictive rules throughout each entire year. </p><p>Through the course of these lifeworks, Hsieh moved from a year of solitary confinement in a sealed cell to a year in which he punched a worker's time clock in his studio every hour on the hour to a year spent living without shelter in Manhattan to a year in which he was tied by an eight-foot rope to the artist Linda Montano and finally to a year of total abstention from all art activities and influences. In 1986 Hsieh announced that he would spend the next thirteen years making art but not showing it publicly. When this &#x201c;final&#x201d; lifework&#x2015;an immense act of self-affirmation and self-erasure&#x2015;came to a close at the turn of the millennium, he tersely and enigmatically said that during this time he had simply kept himself alive.</p><p>After years of near-invisibility, Hsieh collaborated with the British writer and curator Adrian Heathfield to create this meticulous and visually arresting documentary record of the complete body of Tehching Hsieh's performance projects from 1978 to 1999. This milestone volume is now available again, in a paperback edition featuring the full text and all the illustrations in the hardcover, with an updated list of Hsieh's exhibitions.</p><p>Copublished with the Live Art Development Agency, London.</p></p><p>Adrian Heathfield is Professor of Performance and Visual Culture at Roehampton University, London.

This is the first book to deal exclusively with the nature of command itself, and to trace its development over two thousand years from ancient Greece to Vietnam. It treats historically the whole variety of problems involved in commanding armies, including staff organization and administration, communications methods and technologies, weaponry, and logistics. And it analyzes the relationship between these problems and military strategy. </p><p> In vivid descriptions of key battles and campaigns--among others, Napoleon at Jena, Moltke's Kï¿½niggrï¿½tz campaign, the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, and the Americans in Vietnam--van Creveld focuses on the means of command and shows how those means worked in practice. He finds that technological advances such as the railroad, breech-loading rifles, the telegraph and later the radio, tanks, and helicopters all brought commanders not only new tactical possibilities but also new limitations. </p><p> Although vast changes have occurred in military thinking and technology, the one constant has been an endless search for certainty--certainty about the state and intentions of the enemy's forces; certainty about the manifold factors that together constitute the environment in which war is fought, from the weather and terrain to radioactivity and the presence of chemical warfare agents; and certainty about the state, intentions, and activities of one's own forces. The book concludes that progress in command has usually been achieved less by employing more advanced technologies than by finding ways to transcend the limitations of existing ones. </p></p><p>Martin van Creveld was born in the Netherlands in 1946 and has lived in Israel from 1950. Having studied in Jerusalem and London, since 1971 he has been on the faculty of the History Department, the Hebrew University, Jerusalem.

While parents may worry that their children will be at a disadvantage if they are not engaged in constant, explicit learning or using the latest "educational" games, David Elkind's <i>The Power of Play</i> reassures us that unscheduled imaginative play goes far in preparing children for academic and social success. Through expert analysis of the research and powerful situational examples, Elkind shows that, indeed, creative spontaneous activity best sets the stage for academic learning in the first place: Children learn mutual respect and cooperation through role-playing and the negotiation of rules, which in turn prepare them for successful classroom learning; in simply playing with rocks, for example, a child could discover properties of counting and shapes that are the underpinnings of math; even a toddler's babbling is a necessary precursor to the acquisition of language. An important contribution to the literature about how children learn, <i>The Power of Play</i> suggests ways to restore play's respected place in children's lives, at home, at school, and in the larger community. In defense of unstructured "down time," it encourages parents to trust their instincts and resist the promise of the wide and dubious array of educational products on the market geared to youngsters.</p><p><b>David Elkind</b>, Ph.D., is Professor Emeritus at Tufts University and the author of a dozen books, including <i>The Hurried Child</i> and <i>All Grown Up and No Place to Go</i>. He lives outside of Boston and on Cape Cod.<i>Starred Review.</i> In this fascinating look at the importance of letting kids be kids, Elkind argues that "Play is being silenced." According to Elkind, a child psychologist and author of <i>All Grown Up and No Place to Go</i>, important, unstructured play is too often replaced in modern times by organized activities, academics or passive leisure activities such as watching television and playing video games. Elkind explains how even toys have changed: "toys once served to socialize children into social roles, vocations, and academic tool skills. Today, they are more likely to encourage brand loyalties, fashion consciousness, and group think." Elkind acknowledges that technology has its place in the classroom, but debunks computer programs marketed toward babies and preschoolers whose young brains are not yet able to fully comprehend two-dimensional representations. "Parent peer pressure" is often to blame, causing parents to engage in "hyperparenting, overprotection, and overprogramming." Media-spread fears about everything from kidnapping and molestation to school shootings and SIDS can cause parents to forget that "children can play safely without adult organization; they have done so as long as people have been on earth." With clarity and insight, Elkind calls for society to bring back long recesses, encourage imagination and let children develop their minds at a natural pace. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero&#x2019;s foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collins&#x2019;s narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. <br><br>Collins&#x2019;s other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone,</i> has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: &#x201c;Author of<b> The Woman in White</b>.&#x201d;</p><p>Still unsurpassed as a masterpiece of narrative drive and excruciating suspense, &#39;The Woman in White&#39; is also famous for introducing, in the figure of Count Fosco, the prototype of the suave, sophisticated evil genius. The first detective novel ever written, it has remained, since its publication in 1860, the most admired example of the genre.William Wilkie Collins was born in London in 1824, the eldest son of a successful painter, William Collins. He studied law and was admitted to the bar but never practiced his nominal profession, devoting his time to writing instead. His first published book was a biography of his father, his second a florid historical romance. The first hint of his later talents came with <i>Basil</i> (1852), a vivid tale of seduction, treachery, and revenge.<br><br>In 1851 Collins had met Charles Dickens, who would become his close friend and mentor. Collins was soon writing unsigned articles and stories for Dickens&#x2019;s magazine, <i>Household Words</i>, and his novels were serialized in its pages. Collins brought out the boyish, adventurous side of Dickens&#x2019;s character; the two novelists traveled to Italy, Switzerland, and France together, and their travels produced such lighthearted collaborations as &#x201c;The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices.&#x201d; They also shared a passion for the theater, and Collins&#x2019;s melodramas, notably &#x201c;The Frozen Deep,&#x201d; were presented by Dickens&#x2019;s private company, with Dickens and Collins in leading roles.<br><br>Collins&#x2019;s first mystery novel was <i>Hide and Seek</i> (1853). His first popular success was <b>The Woman in White</b> (1860), followed by <i>No Name</i> (1862), <i>Armadale</i> (1866), and <i>The Moonstone</i> (1868), whose Sergeant Cuff became a prototype of the detective hero in English fiction. Collins&#x2019;s concentration on the seamier side of life did not endear him to the critics of his day, but he was among the most popular of Victorian novelists. His meticulously plotted, often violent novels are now recognized as the direct ancestors of the modern mystery novel and thriller.<br><br>Collins&#x2019;s private life was an open secret among his friends. He had two mistresses, one of whom bore him three children. His later years were marred by a long and painful eye disease. His novels, increasingly didactic, declined greatly in quality, but he continued to write by dictating to a secretary until 1886. He died in 1889.</p><h2>Pride &amp; Prejudice</h2><p>Pride and Prejudice Read more</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

For example, <em>remember past grace</em>. <em>Rehearse your identity in Christ</em>. <em>Avail yourself of the means of grace</em>. <em>Discipline yourself</em>. But Scripture portrays the dynamics of sanctification in a rich variety of ways. No single factor, truth, or protocol can capture why and how a person is changed into the image of Christ. <br><br>Weaving together personal stories, biblical exposition, and theological reflection, David Powlison shows the personal and particular ways that God meets you where you are to produce change. He highlights the variety of factors that work together, helping us to avoid sweeping generalizations and pat answers in the search for a key to sanctification. This book is a go-to resource for understanding the multifaceted, lifelong, personal journey of sanctification.</p></p><p><p><strong>David Powlison</strong>&nbsp;(1949&#x2013;2019)&nbsp;was a teacher, a counselor, and the executive director of the Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation for many years. He&nbsp;received&nbsp;his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania&nbsp;and was also the senior editor of the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Biblical Counseling</em>. He wrote a number of&nbsp;books, including&nbsp;<em>How Does Sanctification Work?</em>;&nbsp;<em>Making All Things New</em>; and&nbsp;<em>God's Grace in Your Suffering</em>.</p><p>Late Executive Director, Christian Counseling &amp;&nbsp;Educational Foundation</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing more invigorating in your walk with Jesus than getting up every morning and getting actively engaged in your own sanctification. To partner with the Spirit of Christ in your own change, growth, and maturity is a wonderful way of &#x2018;making it your ambition to be pleasing to him.&#x2019; And I&#x2019;m so excited that David Powlison shows the reader how to do just this in his remarkable new book <i>How Does Sanctification Work?</i> I give it a hearty thumbs-up!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joni Eareckson Tada,</strong> Founder, Joni and Friends</p><p>&#x201c;Every Christian leader or writer or pastor should have David Powlison whispering in his ear, &#x2018;God&#x2019;s Word is deep and rich . . . don&#x2019;t just sit on one paradigm&#x2015;teach the full counsel of God.&#x2019; This book will do that for you.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul E. Miller,</strong>&nbsp;author, <em>A Praying Life</em> and <em>J-Curve: Dying and Rising with Jesus in Everyday Life</em></p><p>&#x201c;To know David Powlison is to know a man who is growing in the sweet fruit of sanctifying grace. To witness his ministry is to see one whom the Lord is using to sanctify many. That is why I am so grateful for <i>How Does Sanctification Work?</i> One of the most crucial areas of debate among Christians today concerns the doctrine of sanctification. David&#x2019;s is a voice of sound, biblical wisdom in the midst of much confusion. If you are looking for a book on sanctification that is profoundly personal, biblically balanced, and deeply relevant, then this is it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Heath Lambert,</strong>&nbsp;Associate Pastor, First Baptist Church of Jacksonville; Executive Director, Association of Certified Biblical Counselors; author, <em>A Theology of Biblical Counseling </em>and<em> Finally Free</em></p><p>&#x201c;When I think about wise men who have shaped my life and thinking, David Powlison consistently rises to the top. His thoughtful and incisive insight into the human heart and what makes sanctification work is something each of us desperately needs. David recognizes that for all the conversation and writing which have taken place on the topic of sanctification, what seems to be left out is <i>you</i>! David helps bring his personal story and others&#x2019; narratives into the discussion surrounding sanctification, and in so doing reminds us of the multifaceted way God works in people&#x2019;s lives. Grab this book today, read it and soak it in, and join David and many others in the process of becoming more like our Savior.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jonathan Holmes,</strong> Pastor of Counseling, Parkside Church; Executive Director, Fieldstone Counseling; Council Member, Biblical Counseling Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Sanctification</i> is a very long word. Though many Christians would be able to give a simple definition such as &#x2018;growing in holiness&#x2019; or &#x2018;becoming like Jesus,&#x2019; few have given much thought to the dynamics of how it happens&#x2015;how it works. In <i>How Does Sanctification Work?</i>, Powlison helpfully identifies five ways our growth in holiness happens. The principles are grounded in Scripture and illustrated by a transparent look at how it has &#x2018;worked&#x2019; in his own life. And this is an encouragement for us to see how it&#x2015;no, how God&#x2019;s <i>Spirit</i>&#x2015;is at work in our lives, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy Z. Witmer,</strong> Professor of Practical Theology, Westminster Theological Seminary; Pastor, St. Stephen Reformed Church, New Holland, Pennsylvania; author, <em>The Shepherd Leader </em>and<em> The Shepherd Leader at Home</em></p><p>&#x201c;In this book, David Powlison sets out a case against simplistic statements that sanctification can be reduced to a &#x2018;just do this&#x2019; or &#x2018;just believe that&#x2019; kind of process. Doing what he always does so brilliantly, he shows us how the riches of Scripture get applied to the details of life. Personal, practical, and bursting with fresh and important insights, here is a book to help God&#x2019;s people become more like Christ.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Steve Midgley,</strong>&nbsp;Executive Director, Biblical Counselling UK; Senior Pastor, Christ Church Cambridge</p><p>&#x201c;Sanctification is essential to fulfilling our greatest calling in life: namely, to love God with all our hearts and love our neighbors as ourselves. David has not only set forth the essential themes of this process but also described many of the spiritual nuances that guide our steps through this blessed transformation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ken Sande,</strong>&nbsp;President, Relational Wisdom 360; author,&nbsp;<em>The Peacemaker</em></p><p>&#x201c;Sanctification is a life-and-death matter. What David Powlison offers in this book is no mere how-to manual on having your quiet time. Instead, behind this straightforward title lies an explosively powerful and practical theology of human transformation. This book is deep enough to instruct those who have spent their lives agonizing over how sanctification really works, and accessible enough to guide those who have never had the question cross their minds. In short, this book will leave you fundamentally changed for the better.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. Alasdair Groves,</strong>&nbsp;Director of Counseling, CCEF New England</p><p>&#x201c;<em>How Does Sanctification Work?</em> will refresh the souls of all who desire to grow in authentic holiness. The reader will find no &#x2018;one-size-fits-all&#x2019; formulas here, but rather the wise, biblical counsel of a refined theological mind as to how sanctification takes place through our relationship with God and the people that God has placed in our lives&#x2015;to variably and uniquely shape our souls for our ultimate home with Christ.

Feldenkrais uses rational and intuitive approaches to help his student relearn basic motor skills. One can observe here the groundwork of Feldenkrais' extraordinary insights which became known as the Feldenkrais Method. We follow his detailed descriptions of the trial and error process which led him to see the ingredients that were needed to help Nora reshape her attention, perception, imagination and cognition.</p><p>Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., is the founder of what is today called the Feldenkrais Method. As a result of suffering debilitating injuries Feldenkrais began an intense exploration into the relationship between bodily movement and healing, feeling, thinking, and learning. In the process of healing himself, Feldenkrais made revolutionary discoveries, culminating in the development of the method that now bears his name. There are two aspects to his method: an individual manipulatory technique of neuromotor education called Functional Integration and a group technique called Awareness Through Movement. His unique and subtle approach to facilitating human change and to improving functioning is spelled out in a number of influential books, including: Awareness Through Movement, Body and Mature Behavior, and The Elusive Obvious. Dr. Feldenkrais was also the author of a number of books about Judo and one of the first Europeans to hold a black belt in the art. Today there are nearly four thousand Feldenkrais Method Practitioners around the globe. His insights contributed to the development of the new field of somatic education and continue to influence disciplines such as the arts, education, psychology, child development, physical and occupational therapy, sports enhancement, and gerontology."...a rare gem.

For centuries the range has inspired cultural pride and a vast outpouring of creative expression. Yet since the partition of Korea in the 1940s, situating them&nbsp;in the North, the Diamond Mountains have remained largely inaccessible to visitors, shrouding the site in legend, loss, and longing.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book examines the visual representation of this remarkable landscape from the 18th century to the present day. It explores how Jeong Seon (1676&#x2013;1759) revolutionized Korean painting with his Diamond Mountains landscapes, replacing conventional generic imagery with specific detail and indelibly influencing generations of artists in his wake. It also discusses the potency of these mountains as an emblem of Korean cultural identity, as reflected in literature and in exquisitely detailed album leaves, handscrolls, hanging scrolls, and screens.

Heuer Jr. </b>is best known for his book <i>Psychology of Intelligence Analysis </i>and for developing and then guiding automation of the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) technique. Both are being used to teach and train intelligence analysts throughout the Intelligence Community and in a growing number of academic programs on intelligence or national security. After retiring from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Mr. Heuer was associated with the Intelligence Community in various roles for more than five decades until his death in August 2018. He has written extensively on personnel security, counterintelligence, deception, and intelligence analysis. Mr. Heuer has a B.A. in philosophy from Williams College and an M.A. in international relations from the University of Southern California. He also pursued graduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Michigan.</p><br><p><b>Randolph H. Pherson</b> is president of Pherson Associates, LLC; CEO of Globalytica, LLC; and a founding director of the nonprofit Forum Foundation for Analytic Excellence. He teaches advanced analytic techniques and critical thinking skills to analysts in the government and private sector. Mr. Pherson collaborated with Richards Heuer Jr. in developing and launching use of Analysis of Competing Hypotheses, and he developed several analytic techniques for the CIA&#x2019;s Sherman Kent School, many of which were incorporated in his <i>Handbook of Analytic Tools and Techniques</i>. He coauthored <i>Critical Thinking for Strategic Intelligence</i> with Katherine Hibbs Pherson, <i>Cases in Intelligence Analysis: Structured Analytic Techniques in Action</i> with Sarah Miller Beebe, and several other guides for analysts on writing, briefing, indicators, and managing the production process. Mr. Pherson completed a twenty-eight-year career in the Intelligence Community in 2000, last serving as National Intelligence Officer (NIO) for Latin America. Previously at the CIA, Mr. Pherson managed the production of intelligence analysis on topics ranging from global instability to Latin America, served on the Inspector General&#x2019;s staff, and was chief of the CIA&#x2019;s Strategic Planning and Management Staff. He is the recipient of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal for his service as NIO and the Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal. Mr. Pherson received his B.A. from Dartmouth College and an M.A. in international relations from Yale University.</p><p><br><b></b></p>Intelligence community (IC) stalwarts Richards Heuer and Randy Pherson have addressed a gaping lacuna in IC scholarship with their <i>Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis</i>. Finally, we have a work that discusses not only the hows but also the whys of analysis. Like Heuer's previous <i>Psychology of Intelligence Analysis</i>, the current volume is destined to become an instant classic; I intend to integrate it into my Intelligence and Security Studies curriculum at the earliest possible opportunity. --Carl Jensen, Director, Center for Intelligence and Security Studies, The University of Mississippi.<br><br>Policy advisers cling to the belief that they can simply think their way through difficult conflicts, despite experimental evidence that shows that they do no better than non-experts. Heuer and Pherson's <i>Structured Analytic Techniques</i> shows how evidence-based techniques can greatly improve experts' judgmental forecasting and decision making. This is the new Bible for decision makers facing conflicts. --J. Scott Armstrong, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania<br><br>Everyone says that intelligence organizations need to consider alternatives and challenge assumptions, but only with <i>Structured Analytic Techniques</i> do we have a detailed presentation of the ways to proceed.

Comparison is a struggle that many girls constantly combat, and that was a challenge throughout the lives of Rachel and Leah in the Bible.&nbsp; Like us, Rachel and Leah experienced disappointment, heartache, brokenness, and emptiness. They had to learn that the success of others is not meant to discourage. And sometimes, through the most difficult times, we learn that God is for us much more than we ever dreamed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the course of six sessions, author Nicki Koziarz will help girls take an honest look at themselves and allow God&#x2019;s truth to combat the comparison they struggle against. God calls girls to trust Him to lead their steps so that they might walk in the fullness of who He created them to be.<br><br><b>Features:</b><ul><li>Leader helps to guide questions and discussions within small groups</li><li>Personal study segments with homework to complete between 6 weeks of group sessions</li><li>A weekly Bible verse to help combat comparison</li><li>Optional six interactive teaching videos, approximately 5-10 minutes per session, available for purchase separately</li></ul> &nbsp;<br><b>Benefits:</b><ul><li>Discover what the Bible says about God, Rachel, Leah, and Jacob, and how He used flawed people for His kingdom.</li><li>Learn to define success through a biblical perspective.</li><li>Remember that someone else&#x2019;s gain is not your loss.</li><li>Evaluate the impact of comparison in your life.</li></ul></p><p><b>Why her?</b><br><br> Every girl asks this quiet question in her heart at some point in her life. Or perhaps, she asks &#x201c;Why not me?&#x201d; These questions rise from a struggle with comparison that many girls constantly combat. Her outfit is cooler. Her Instagram account has more followers. Her life seems more exciting. And she always has it all together. Why her?<br><br> This battle with comparison didn&#x2019;t begin with the rise of social media (although that seems to have made it worse). We can actually trace this battle all the way back to the Old Testament story of Rachel and Leah. Join Nicki Koziarz in this six-week Bible study as she unpacks the twisting, turning tale of these two sisters. As you unpack the emptiness, brokenness, and heartache they experienced in their rival relationship, you&#x2019;ll be able to pinpoint your own comparison battles. As you do, you&#x2019;ll invite God to bring healing and freedom to your life through the truth of His Word.<br><br> In this 6-session Bible study with optional videos, you will:<br> ï¿½ Spot your comparison battles and learn how to combat them with the truth of God&#x2019;s Word.<br> ï¿½ Understand the story of Rachel and Leah more deeply.<br> ï¿½ Embrace God&#x2019;s good work in your life even when days seem hard.<br><br> ALSO AVAILABLE <i>Rachel &amp; Leah</i> Adult Women&#x2019;s Study, <i>Why Her?</i> book, E-book, optional video sessions, and promotional materials available at LifeWay.com/RachelandLeahNICKI KOZIARZ is a wife, mom, author &amp; speaker with Proverbs 31 Ministries.

"I had the feeling that I was standing at the cradle of a new mythology. A last will and testament...we as the posthumous heirs of Them..."A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book<br></p><p>&#34;Twenty-five hundred scientists have been herded into an isolated site in the Nevada desert. A neutrino message of extraterrestrial origin has been received, and, under the surveillance of the Pentagon, the scientists labor on His Master&#39;s Voice, the secret program set up to decipher the transmission.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;Among them is Peter Hogarth, an eminent mathematician whose posthumous diary makes up the novel. Hogarth joins His Master&#39;s Voice after all efforts to decode the message prove futile and, after an early success, gives up on the project to pursue clandestine research into the so-called TX effect. Hogarth comes to realize that the TX effect could lead to the construction of the ultimate weapon - a fission bomb - and that such knowledge must not be allowed into the hands of the military.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;Originally published in 1968, His Master&#39;s Voice takes to task the military takeover of scientific research, Cold War - era politics, and humanity&#39;s perpetual capacity for (self-)destruction. It remains a mordant satire on scientific microworlds and the monstrous political and military systems bankrolling them.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.Stanislaw Lem (1921-2006) was the most widely translated and best known science fiction author writing outside of the English language.

In this wide-ranging, interdisciplinary study, Andrew C. Isenberg argues that the cultural and ecological encounter between Native Americans and Euroamericans in the Great Plains was the central cause of the near extinction of the bison. Drought and the incursion of domestic livestock and exotic species such as horses into the Great Plains all threatened the Western ecosystem, which was further destabilized as interactions between Native Americans and Euroamericans created new types of hunters in both cultures: mounted Indian nomads and white commercial hide hunters. In the early twentieth century, nostalgia about the very cultural strife that first threatened the bison became, ironically, an important impetus to its preservation.</p><p>Andrew C. Isenberg is Professor of History at Temple University. Isenberg&#39;s research interests include environmental history, the history of the North American West, the United States from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century, and the encounter between Euroamericans and natives. He is the author of Mining California: An Ecological History (2005) and the editor of The Nature of Cities: Culture, Landscape, and Urban Space (2006)."Thoroughly researched and well-written, The Destruction of the Bison is an example of modern interdisciplinary scholarship that is not only convincing, analytical, and informative, but also a joy to read. This book will prove valuable to the academic specialist, the student, and the general public." American Studies International<br><br>"The Destruction of the Bison is an engaging, well-written, and lucid account of a story that has been told many times, but is only now beginning to be truly understood." Peter S. Alagona, The Professional Geographer<br><br>"Isenberg's well-researched and very readable environmental history provides a more compelling explanation that acknowledges the interaction between a dynamic natural environment and the human societies that inhabited it." Economic History<br><br>"...elegant....Isenberg has found an impressive array of sources for his history....a detailed, convincing instance of how civilizations expand, it is profoundly instructive." William H. McNeill, The New York Review of Books<br><br>"A well-researched, well-documented book, The Destruction of Bison is, best of all, a compelling read. It has a narrative that sweeps the reader through the two hundred pages quickly. The book is, simply, an engrossing history...the book remains one that students, academics, and many adults would learn from and enjoy. The Destruction of Bison would be a good choice for academic libraries as well as for many public library collections. Highly recommended." E-Streams<br><br>"This case study of extinction and the preservation of a species will have a wide appeal and correlate with such books as Shepard Krech's The Ecological Indian: Myth and History. Recommended for all libraries." Library Journal<br><br>"To be filed in this month's don't-judge-a-book-by-its title category....[Isenberg's] impassioned first book is much more than an ecological history of American wildlife." Publisher's Weekly<br><br>"The book works well as a teaching tool: it reveals complex causation while maintaining clarity and readability. As enviornmental history, the book is extremely satisfying...Isenberg appreciates the dynamism of culture, economy, and environment on the Plains. His treatment of Indian experiences, though overgeneralized, is still subtle and complex."

But there are plenty of healthy options, such as Chicken Smothered in Black Beans (which uses a mere two tablespoons of oil), meatless Stuffed Eggplant Pirogues, and a brown-rice salad topped with roasted nuts and raisins. Besides the lighter fare, there's also a noticeable international tilt; Prudhomme plays creatively with imported exotica such as balsamic vinegar and coconut milk, but always in a Louisiana context. Shrimp in Tropical Cream is a Creole-cum-Indian curry studded with diced papaya and mango, while Crab Claws Vinaigrette fuses white balsamic vinegar, rice vinegar, and Japanese mirin rice wine with his signature mix of cayenne, black pepper, and onion and garlic powders. </p><p> Prudhomme's recipes usually require a commitment, as he doesn't stint on the number of ingredients or cooking steps. But the average two-page length of the recipes is deceptive: They read long because Prudhomme is beside you every minute, describing how the food will taste and bringing up interesting tidbits related to the cooking process. Novice cooks who pay attention will pick up valuable tips, while devotees will appreciate how Prudhomme's palate has expanded beyond the borders of Louisiana. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Chef Paul Prudhomme is the owner of K-Paul&#39;s Louisiana Kitchen and Magic Seasoning Blends, both in New Orleans.

Since 2000, science has seen a surge in data and interest on several fronts related to E.T. (extraterrestrials); A.I. (artificial intelligence); and SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence). The debate has intensified over whether life exists outside our solar system, what that life would look like, and whether we&#x2019;ll ever make contact.</p><p>Included here are essays from a broad spectrum of the scientific community: cosmologists, astrophysicists, NASA planetary scientists, and geneticists, to name just a few, discussing the latest research and theories relating to alien life. Some of the topics include: If life exists somewhere in space, what are the odds that it evolves into something we would recognize as intelligent? What will space travel look like in the future, and will it all be done by cyborg technology? How long until we are ruled by robot overlords? (This is actually a serious consideration.) Are we simply a simulation in the mind of some supreme being, acting out a virtual reality game?</p><p>For those who have ever wondered, <i>Is there anybody out there?</i> here are the latest theories and evidence that move us closer to answering that question.</p></p><p><b>JIM AL-KHALILI</b> is a quantum physicist, author, and broadcaster based at the University of Surrey in England.

But while philosophers have sought to understand the ramifications of his theories, they have paid much less attention to how, exactly, he arrived at his ideas. What twists and turns of his intellect brought him to his epochal conclusions? How did his personal ambitions and the social conditions of his era shape his thought? These questions and more are masterfully answered in Stephen Gaukroger's <em>Descartes</em>, a fascinating look at this most influential of all Renaissance thinkers.<br> In his quest to retrace Descartes's development as a scientist and philosopher, Gaukroger leaves no stone unturned. From the great man's first book on music theory (<em>Compendium Musicae</em>) to his masterworks <em>Discours</em>, <em>Essais</em>, <em>Meditationes</em>, and <em>Principia</em>, from his study of mathematics while attending a Jesuit college at age ten, through his dying days in the service of Christina, Queen of Sweden, <em>Descartes</em> brims with penetrating and often surprising insights into the philosopher's life and work. We discover, for example, that he wasn't as concerned with developing an all-encompassing theory of knowledge as he was with establishing a natural philosophy that supported the teachings of Copernicus, a man whose work he deeply admired. We also learn that Descartes was willing to alter his publicly stated views to accommodate church doctrine--especially after witnessing Galileo's condemnation in 1633. We observe how his personal triumphs and failures--from his rumored nervous breakdown in 1614, to his joy at the popular reception of <em>Discours</em> and <em>Essais</em>, to his protracted and very public dispute with the implacable professor Voetius--affected his intellectual development. Along the way, Gaukroger details how Descartes's theories of metaphysics, mechanics, cognition, and cosmology have been both championed and distorted by philosophers of all stripes for over three hundred years. Packed with helpful diagrams and in-depth interpretations of Descartes's most celebrated works, the book also includes a useful chronology that highlights his important accomplishments and personal milestones.<br> <em>Descartes</em> is an exhaustively detailed, magisterial look at the dazzling intellectual achievements of the father of modern philosophy. Splendidly written by a renowned authority on the subject, it will serve as the definitive guide to Descartes's thoughts, works, and life for years to come.<br></p><p>Rene Descartes (1596-1650) is the father of modern philosophy, and one of the greatest of all thinkers. This is the first intellectual biography of Descartes in English; it offers a fundamental reassessment of all aspects of his life and work. Stephen Gaukroger, a leading authority on Descartes, traces his intellectual development from childhood, showing the connections between his intellectual and personal life and placing these in the cultural context of seventeenth-century Europe. Descartes&#39; early work in mathematics and science produced ground-breaking theories, methods, and tools still in use today. This book gives the first full account of how this work informed and influenced the later philosophical studies for which, above all, Descartes is renowned. Not only were philosophy and science intertwined in Descartes&#39; life; so were philosophy and religion. The Church of Rome found Galileo guilty of heresy in 1633; two decades earlier, Copernicus&#39; theories about the universe had been denounced as blasphemous. To avoid such accusations, Descartes clothed his views about the relation between God and humanity, and about the nature of the universe, in a philosophical garb acceptable to the Church. His most famous project was the exploration of the foundations of human knowledge, starting from the proof of one&#39;s own existence offered in the formula Cogito ergo sum, &#39;I am thinking therefore I exist&#39;. Stephen Gaukroger argues that this was not intended as an exercise in philosophical scepticism, but rather to provide Descartes&#39; scientific theories, influenced as they were by Copernicus and Galileo, with metaphysical legitimation. This book offers for the first time a full understanding of howDescartes developed his revolutionary ideas. It will be a landmark publication, welcomed by all readers interested in the origins of modern thought.<br><strong>Stephen Gaukroger</strong> is Fellow the Australian Academy of Humanities and President of the Australian Society for the History of Philosophy.<br></p><h2>A Short History of the Western Liturgy</h2><p>A Short History of the Western Liturgy An Account and some Reflections</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)<br>"A modern classic."--<em>The Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"Of extraordinary value is the...extensive bibliography--a real treasure-trove of information--which provides directions for further study and research."--<em>Modern Liturgy</em><p></p><br>"Clearly organized and written in an easy-to-understand style...should be quite useful as a basic text for the study of Western liturgy....Very useful and informative."--<em>Catholic Library World</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Beautiful Boss (The Beautiful Series)</h2><p>The ninth work in the <i>New York Times</i> and #1 internationally bestselling series that started with <i>Beautiful Bastard. </i>In this novella, Will Sumner and Hanna Bergstrom (from <i>Beautiful Player</i>) find that a wedding and everlasting love were just the beginning.<br><br>One Player tamed.

Hanna hated sleeping apart on her recent trips for faculty position interviews nearly as much as I did. And the night before our wedding her mother gets us separate rooms, to keep tradition, build suspense?<br> <br>Forget it.<br> <br>It wouldn&#x2019;t last.<br> <br>I reached behind me, fluffing the pillows, and then stretched out on the giant king-size bed.<br> <br>My cell phone buzzed on the bedside table and I laughed, saying, &#x201c;Called it,&#x201d; to the empty room before answering, &#x201c;Hanna, my love.&#x201d;<br> <br>She skipped the greeting entirely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m nervous.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled into the phone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised. You&#x2019;re promising to obey me and be my sex slave for the remainder of your days. You know I won&#x2019;t go easy on you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t even spare me a laugh. &#x201c;Can I come to your room?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been hoping you would come down&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she interrupted with force. &#x201c;No, I can&#x2019;t. That was a test, Will. You&#x2019;re supposed to say it&#x2019;s bad luck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m an atheist,&#x201d; I reminded her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in luck. I believe in intent. I believe in discovery. I believe in sex before the wedding. In fact, I believe you are three doors down, completely wigging out, when you could come in here and talk. And then let me put my penis in you. I&#x2019;ll stare at you the entire time, too, and our marriage will still be the most amazing marriage in the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My boobs look enormous in my wedding dress.&#x201d;<br> <br>I groaned, throwing my arm over my face. &#x201c;Are you trying to kill me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just wanted to warn you.&#x201d; Her voice grew slightly slurred and I could immediately imagine her nervously chewing on a fingernail. &#x201c;I think maybe it&#x2019;s overboard. I wanted it to be a cute thing between us&#x2014;your boob obsession, our wedding; I mean, you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hanna,&#x201d; I cut in. &#x201c;I promise to do my best not to motorboat you at the altar.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t what I mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Plum. Breathe.&#x201d; I heard her take a long inhale and slowly let it out. &#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; I said quietly. &#x201c;What did you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just that . . . what if I look . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perfect?&#x201d; I suggested.<br> <br>She blew out a burst of air and admitted in a rush, &#x201c;Busty&#x2014;like a busty whore bride.&#x201d;<br> <br>I held back a laugh, because while this was ridiculous to me, I knew it wasn&#x2019;t to her. &#x201c;Are we seriously doing this right now? This is your pre-wedding freak-out? That your boobs will look too awesome tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hanna had dealt with the wedding planning with ease, handing over the final details to her mom while she traveled all over for job interviews. She was being recruited by schools in nearly every corner of the country, sometimes going to two different places in a single week. And she&#x2019;d never once complained about the madness of the past few months. I knew my Hanna was laid-back, but&#x2014;Jesus&#x2014;given everything, I had expected . . . something. A meltdown while we packed, maybe? But no, we got into a playful laundry war and ended up having sex in the hallway. Maybe a nitpicky fight on the drive up to Beantown? But no, she gave me head. Even a tantrum once we reached the hotel? Nope. She grinned and stretched to kiss me before yelling, &#x201c;Here we go!&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked around the empty hotel room, saying, &#x201c;I feel like I&#x2019;m getting off easy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her little growl made my mouth curve into a smile, but it straightened when her voice came out reedy and stressed. &#x201c;What if my dress is all boob and you&#x2019;re like the only one who doesn&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s obscene?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you came down the aisle topless I would be completely okay with this. And mine is the only opinion that matters tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why did we invite a hundred and sixty-four other people?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hanna. Shut up, right now. Come to my room to get laid.&#x201d;<br> <br>The line clicked dead, and a few seconds later I heard feet shuffling in front of my door, a long pause, and then a quiet knock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Close your eyes,&#x201d; she called from the hallway.<br> <br>I walked over, closed my eyes tight, and opened the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep them closed,&#x201d; she warned.<br> <br>I squeezed them tighter, obediently.<br> <br>Her hands moved to my neck and slid up to my face, fumbling in her nervousness before finally managing to tie something around my eyes. And then she fell quiet. I couldn&#x2019;t see her, couldn&#x2019;t feel her.<br> <br>Reaching out, I found her waist, pulled her to my bare chest. &#x201c;Tell me what&#x2019;s really going on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like not being with you the night before our wedding,&#x201d; she confessed into my skin. &#x201c;I need you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Blindly, I ran my hands up her sides, over her shoulders, and along her neck before cupping her face. My fingers met soft silk, and I followed the path of the fabric to a knot at the back of her head.<br> <br>Hanna had tied a scarf around her eyes, too. Oh, this one.<br> <br>Laughing, I kissed the top of her head. &#x201c;So stay with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She groaned. &#x201c;This tradition sucks, but I feel like if there are any traditions I should listen to, it&#x2019;s the ones about how to not mess this marriage up. We can&#x2019;t see each other until tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>I held her face in my hands, tilting it so I could kiss her. My lips met the tip of her nose first, before traveling south to their target. &#x201c;There is no way to mess this up,&#x201d; I said, right against her mouth. &#x201c;Even if we didn&#x2019;t get married tomorrow, you&#x2019;re the love of my life. I&#x2019;m with you until we both die, at the same time, when I am one hundred and you are ninety-three.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a quiet laugh, she turned me, guiding me to the bed and carefully pulling me down onto it. She pushed me until I was lying on my back and then climbed over my hips.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are your eyes open now?&#x201d; I asked her, teasing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I lifted the blindfold for a second, but they&#x2019;re closed again. Someone had to navigate us here safely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, I think the rule is the groom can&#x2019;t see the bride, right? You can look at me,&#x201d; I whispered.<br> <br>She paused. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, Plum.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a short hesitation, I heard the shift of her blindfold as she removed it and then the sound of her quiet breaths.<br> <br>&#x201c;There you are.&#x201d; She ran a hand up my chest and over my neck, and then a single fingertip traced the shape of my mouth. &#x201c;Husband. Isn&#x2019;t that crazy?&#x201d;<br> <br>My skin ignited, hungry. &#x201c;Hann&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mouth came over mine, shutting me up, lips wet and so fucking full, hands working my boxers down my hips. She licked my neck, her hair tickling my skin as she made her way down my chest, past my stomach . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good luck to give head before the wedding,&#x201d; I confirmed when she wrapped her hand around me, licking near the base and dragging her tongue to the tip. &#x201c;So we&#x2019;re on the right track.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her giggle vibrated against me as she kissed and sucked, licking me hard as fucking stone in her grip.<br> <br>&#x201c;Goddamn,&#x201d; I whispered, hips arching from the bed. &#x201c;Plum, this blindfold . . . your tongue. Fuck.&#x201d;<br> <br>She played with me just enough to have me rocking up from the mattress and then I felt her shift and pull her little nightie up over her hips and straddle me.<br> <br>Her mouth came down against my ear. &#x201c;No grabbing my boobs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever you say,&#x201d; I swore immediately. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a gift for bruising boobs. My dress shows boob.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mentioned this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you bruise them, no head for a year.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even though she was probably&#x2014;I think?&#x2014;joking, the idea made my heart stop for about three beats.<br> <br>I gave her a reverent &#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>She reached for me, rubbing me over the perfect, slippery skin between her legs. My hands made fists around the sheets at my sides.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hanna?&#x201d; I asked in a breathless burst.<br> <br>Pausing, she asked, &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I grab your hips, though?&#x201d;<br> <br>I could feel her go still over me and then start to laugh. &#x201c;What in the world kind of dress would show my hips?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, sorry,&#x201d; I said, laughing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not thinking. Holy fuck, Plum, just get on my dick.&#x201d;<br> <br>But she didn&#x2019;t. I could feel the heat of her, so close, and she slowly settled back down on my thighs, her hands running up over my stomach.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; I asked, sitting up beneath her and clumsily finding her face again with my hands. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re freaking out about the dress again?&#x201d; I tried to surreptitiously swipe my thumbs beneath her eyes to make sure she wasn&#x2019;t crying, but she ducked away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not crying.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded, going quiet, wanting to tread carefully.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just nervous,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>My chest twisted. &#x201c;You know that just because we&#x2019;re getting married doesn&#x2019;t mean that anything between us changes, right? We&#x2019;re still Will and Hanna. We&#x2019;re still us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It feels different already,&#x201d; she said, and slid her fingertips over my lips when I opened my mouth to protest, quickly adding, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean that in a bad way. I mean, it feels deeper. It feels more important. Before, I would look at your body and think, &#x2018;Wow, I get to play with this all night long!&#x2019; Now, I look at your body and think, &#x2018;Wow, I get to play with this, and Oh my God what if anything ever happened to him and&#x2014;&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hanna. Breathe,&#x201d; I said gently from beneath her fingers.<br> <br>She took a calming breath, sliding her hand down my neck almost as if she was tracing a line to my heart. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only twenty-five,&#x201d; she said after a long pause. &#x201c;And I know my life would be ruined if I lost you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The idea of it stabbed sharply into my gut. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re never going to lose me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t say anything, just drew tiny circles on my chest with her fingertip.<br> <br>&#x201c;Plum, come on. We already take such good care of each other. This just makes it official.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her finger came up again, crossing from one side of my bottom lip to the other, stroking. Thunder pounded through my blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;I take care of you?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You do. And when you&#x2019;re not sure how, you ask.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a few breaths of silence, she said, &#x201c;Like now?&#x201d;<br> <br>I both loved and hated the darkness of the blindfold. I wanted to see her face, but from her voice alone I could imagine it: lip being gently chewed between her teeth, eyes fixed on where her fingers touched my skin with maddening care. This was how we started. She asked, I guided.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not sure how to take care of me right now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just anxious tonight,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;It helps when you tell me what you want me to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>My heart seemed to stutter and then explode. It had been a while since we&#x2019;d played in these roles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bring your hips back over me,&#x201d; I instructed, my voice a rough growl.<br> <br>I felt her shift, and then the heat of her, so intense, barely pressed down on my dick. I bit back a groan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take me in. Slow. Tease me a little.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her hand came around, steadying as she placed herself over me, rubbing, lowering, bit by bit.<br> <br>Good holy fuck.<br> <br>I nearly lost it. &#x201c;Like that. Like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Will . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>A thousand times we&#x2019;d made love. Maybe more. And it shocked me to no end that I always found myself counting to ten and distracting myself so I wouldn&#x2019;t explode as soon as she took me in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Down and up,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tease. Let me feel every inch.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her breath was a shiver of heat on my neck, her hair tickled along my shoulders, and she did exactly what I asked. But she could have easily taken me in in a single stroke. She was wet as the ocean.<br> <br>My thoughts spun off the rails over the intensity of it, as it all seemed to hit me in a rush: here we were, on the cusp of this wild fucking adventure&#x2014;I&#x2019;d never wanted anything more in my entire life.<br> <br>And as Hanna moved slowly onto me, and then rocked above, growing confident, forgetting herself, losing herself, I reeled in the truth of that. How many people find the person they ache to touch, to be near, to belong to? How many people married their best friend, the person they admired most in the whole world?<br> <br>I pulled my blindfold off, catching her face just as she fell: eyes fixed on my face, lips parted in a breathless moan. Relief washed over her expression when our eyes met&#x2014;she needed to see this, see me, be steadied by my gaze&#x2014;and I knew she could read my thoughts as clearly as I could read hers.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t trust someone else&#x2019;s tradition, I thought, feeling my body work its way higher, closer. Trust me. Trust us to find our own path.<br> <br>Need and pleasure wrestled their way down my spine, hot and urgent. My fingers dug into her hips, shoving her roughly back and forth over me until I could feel it right there, right at the edge, and her whisper, I love watching you come, pushed me over the edge, too.<br> <br>I came into her with a rough groan, eyes clinging desperately to hers.<br> <br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; she whispered, face damp with sweat when she pressed it to my neck. &#x201c;I needed this. Tomorrow is a formality. Right now it feels like we just got married.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tomorrow has been a formality ever since you gave me a hand job at a gross student party.&#x201d;<br> <br>Above me, she giggled.<br> <br><br> <br>Hanna was gone when I woke up, and her quickly scribbled note left on my pillow&#x2014;See you at two!&#x2014;made me laugh out loud in the empty room.<br> <br>My fiancï¿½e: what a goddamn romantic.<br> <br>The morning was packed with a groomsmen breakfast; greeting guests checking into the hotel; my mother and sisters constantly finding me to double-check seating details, delivery instructions, and musician requests. Sensing my need to just take a fucking shower and get ready for my wedding, Jensen swooped in, taking them to find the Command Center (Hanna&#x2019;s mother, Helena), who was more than happy to delegate jobs all damn day.<br> <br>A hot shower, a good clean shave, and three cups of coffee later, I heard a knock at my hotel room door. A part of me wondered if it might be Hanna, but realized that could only be possible if she had escaped her sister, Liv; her mother; George; and both Chloe and Sara. Aka &#x201c;the Pride,&#x201d; as Jensen liked to call them, as if they were a pack of lions. If she had somehow managed all that, there would be bodies somewhere, and seeing me before the wedding would be the least of our worries.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I heard my nearly-brother-in-law say.<br> <br>I let Jensen into my suite. He was already dressed, wearing the standard tux, and looking pretty damn great. I&#x2019;d been with him all day yesterday, but somehow in the packed frenzy of the rehearsal schedule, I hadn&#x2019;t registered that he&#x2019;d probably lost thirty pounds since I&#x2019;d last seen him.<br> <br>&#x201c;You been working out? You look good, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re marrying my sister,&#x201d; he said, stepping past me. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t hit on me today.&#x201d;<br> <br>Laughing, I turned back to the mirror to tie my bow tie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marrying,&#x201d; he repeated, letting out a low whistle.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was going to be my wife. I would get to introduce her that way.<br> <br>This is my wife.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t stop rolling the word around in my head. Wife. It felt good. It felt substantial. It made me want to climb over her, say it over and over again into her ear, tattooing it in her thoughts.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re my wife, Plum.<br> <br>Jensen jerked me from this train of thought when he clapped a hand over my shoulder. &#x201c;Married, Will.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked over at him, repeating with a curious smile, &#x201c;I know, Jensen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To my little sister.&#x201d; His eyes narrowed as he pointed a mildly threatening finger at me. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s weir...</p><h2>Learning as Transformation: Critical Perspectives on a Theory in Progress</h2><p>"Provocative and illuminating, this book is a must read for adult educators seeking to understand and facilitate transformational learning.

The grandmothers of the family devised clever ways to disguise the fact that they were still keeping kosher while appearing to be eating pork. Until modern times, the family pretended to be devout Catholics, yet passed many of the Jewish customs on, sometimes in the form of these recipes, their true legacy. For several hundred years they hid their fasts and celebration of Jewish holidays, revealing them only via their recipes and some kosher kitchen customs. This collection was found recently, hidden away at Genie Milgrom&#39;s mother&#39;s house.</p><p><i>Recipes of My 15 Grandmother</i>s is a unique cookbook that contains centuries-old recipes of your grandmothers from the times of Crypto-Jews. Why was this an important book for you to write?<br>Keeping the memories of my ancestors alive is very important to me. So many times once the elders die, the younger generation has no idea what their history was. I find that by recording the recipes of my grandmothers and by telling stories that were passed down to me, I am successfully leaving bread crumbs for the future generations of my family.<br>Was there a lot of research you had to do for this book? Did you have to hunt for the recipes or were they readily available to you?<br>I found the recipes in one place but they were faded, lightly written and difficult to understand I had to do separate research into the Spanish and Portuguese ancient tradition to be able to compile the information historically.<br>My favorite recipe from the collection is Bola Catalana. What is your favorite dish from the book?<br>My favorite dish is the periquillos because through this dish I learned all the customs of my family. I am beyond thrilled whenever I smell them cooking because it transports me right back to my grandmother' kitchen.<br>Do you plan to write more books on food or Jewish history?<br>Yes I do. I am almost finished with a book on Cuban Kosher cooking. While it is not historical, it is a 30 year hands on work as I have changed all the typical Cuban Recipes to Kosher.Genie Milgrom was born in Havana, Cuba, into a Roman Catholic family of Spanish ancestry. In an unparalleled work of genealogy, she was able to fully document her unbroken maternal lineage 22 generations going back as far as 1405 to pre-Inquisition Spain and Portugal.

TAKE CONTROL<p></p> <br>Money is a good servant but a bad master.<br> <br>&#x2014;SIR FRANCIS BACON<br> <br>Money.<br> <br>Few words have the power to provoke such extreme human emotions.<br> <br>A lot of us refuse to even talk about money! Like religion, sex, or politics, the topic is taboo at the dinner table and often off-limits in the workplace. We might discuss wealth in polite company, but money is explicit. It&#x2019;s raw. It&#x2019;s garish. It&#x2019;s intensely personal and highly charged. It can make people feel guilty when they have it&#x2014;or ashamed when they don&#x2019;t.<br> <br>But what does it really mean?<br> <br>For some of us, money is vital and crucial but not paramount. It&#x2019;s simply a tool, a source of power used in service of others and a life well lived. Others are consumed with such a hunger for money that it destroys them and everyone around them. Some are even willing to give up things that are far more valuable to get it: their health, their time, their family, their self-worth, and, in some cases, even their integrity.<br> <br>At its core, money is about power.<br> <br>We&#x2019;ve all seen how money can have the power to create or the power to destroy. It can fund a dream or start a war. You can provide money as a gift or wield it as a weapon. It can be used as an expression of your spirit, your creativity, your ideas&#x2014;or your frustration, your anger, your hate. It can be used to influence governments and individuals. Some marry for it&#x2014;and then find out its real price.<br> <br>But we all know that on some level it&#x2019;s an illusion. Money isn&#x2019;t even gold or paper today, it&#x2019;s zeros and ones in banking computers. What is it? It&#x2019;s like a shape-shifter or a canvas, assuming whatever meaning or emotion we project on it.<br> <br>In the end, money isn&#x2019;t what we&#x2019;re after . . . is it? What we&#x2019;re really after are the feelings, the emotions, we think money can create:<br> <br>that feeling of empowerment,<br> <br>of freedom,<br> <br>of security,<br> <br>of helping those we love and those in need,<br> <br>of having a choice, and<br> <br>of feeling alive.<br> <br>Money is certainly one of the ways we can turn the dreams we have into the reality we live.<br> <br>But even if money is just a perception&#x2014;an abstract concept&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t feel that way if you don&#x2019;t have enough of it! And one thing is for sure: you either use it, or it uses you. You either master money, or, on some level, money masters you!<br> <br>How you deal with money reflects how you deal with power. Is it an affliction or a blessing? A game or a burden?<br> <br>When I was choosing the title of this book, a few people were actually outraged at the suggestion that money could be a game. How could I use such a frivolous term for such a serious topic! But, hey, let&#x2019;s get real. As you&#x2019;ll see in the pages to come, the best way to change your life is to find people who&#x2019;ve already achieved what you want and then model their behavior. Want to master your finances? Find a financial master and imitate how he or she deals with money, and you will have found a pathway to power.<br> <br>I can tell you right now, I have interviewed many of the wealthiest people in the world, and most of them do think of money as a game. Why else would anyone work ten or 12 hours a day after they&#x2019;ve made billions of dollars? And remember, not all games are frivolous. Games are a reflection of life. Some people sit on the sidelines, and some play to win. How do you play? I want to remind you, this is a game that you and your family can&#x2019;t afford to lose.<br> <br>My promise to you is this: if you will stay with me and follow the 7 Simple Steps in this book&#x2014;the steps that have been distilled from the world&#x2019;s most successful financial players&#x2014;you and your family will win this game. And you can win big!<br> <br>But to win, you have to know the rules and learn the best strategies for success from those who have already mastered the game.<br> <br>The good news is that you can save years of time&#x2014;and in a few minutes&#x2014;by simply learning the pitfalls to avoid and the shortcuts to experiencing lasting success. The financial industry often works to make this topic feel incredibly complex, but in reality, once you get past the jargon, it&#x2019;s relatively simple. This book is your opportunity to stop being the chess piece and become the chess player in the game of money. I think you&#x2019;re going to be very surprised at how, with an insider&#x2019;s understanding, you can easily transform your financial life and enjoy the freedom you deserve.<br> <br>So let&#x2019;s get to it. Just imagine what life would be like if you had mastered this game already.<br> <br>What if money didn&#x2019;t matter?<br> <br>How would you feel if you didn&#x2019;t have to worry about going to an office every morning, or paying the bills, or funding your retirement? What would it be like to live your life on your own terms? What would it mean to know you had the opportunity to start your own business, or that you could afford to buy a home for your parents and send your kids to college, or have the freedom to travel the world?<br> <br>How would you live your life if you could wake up each day knowing there was enough money coming in to cover not only your basic needs but also your goals and dreams?<br> <br>The truth is, a lot of us would keep working, because that&#x2019;s the way we&#x2019;re wired. But we&#x2019;d do it from a place of joy and abundance. Our work would continue, but the rat race would end. We&#x2019;d work because we want to, not because we have to.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s financial freedom.<br> <br>But is it a pipe dream? Is it really possible for the average person&#x2014;more importantly, for you&#x2014;to make this dream a reality?<br> <br>Whether you want to live like the 1% or just have the peace of mind from knowing that you won&#x2019;t outlive your savings, the truth is you can always find a way to make the money you need. How? The secret to wealth is simple: Find a way to do more for others than anyone else does. Become more valuable. Do more. Give more. Be more. Serve more. And you will have the opportunity to earn more&#x2014;whether you own the best food truck in Austin, Texas, or you&#x2019;re the top salesperson at your company or even the founder of Instagram.<br> <br>But this book isn&#x2019;t just about adding value&#x2014;it&#x2019;s really about how to go from where you are today to where you truly want to be, whether that&#x2019;s financially secure, independent, or free. It&#x2019;s about increasing the quality of your life today by developing the one fundamental skill that the vast majority of Americans have never developed: the mastery of money. In fact, 77% of Americans&#x2014;three of every four people&#x2014;say they have financial worries, but only 40% report having any kind of spending or investment plan. One in three baby boomers have less than $1,000 saved! Polls show that fewer than one in four trust the financial system&#x2014;with good reason! And stock ownership has been hitting record lows, particularly among young people. But the truth is, you don&#x2019;t earn your way to freedom. As you&#x2019;ll see later in this book, even multimillion-dollar earners such as Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, boxer Mike Tyson, and actress Kim Basinger lost it all because they didn&#x2019;t apply the fundamentals that you&#x2019;ll soon be learning. You have to be able to not only hold on to a portion of what you earn for your family, but, more importantly, multiply what you earn&#x2014;making money while you sleep. You have to make the shift from being a consumer in the economy to becoming an owner&#x2014;and you do it by becoming an investor.<br> <br>Actually, a lot of us are already investors. Maybe you first got into the game when Grandma bought you a few shares of her favorite stock just for being born, or perhaps your employer auto-enrolled you in the company&#x2019;s 401(k), or maybe you first became an investor when a friend told you to forget the Kindle and buy Amazon stock instead.<br> <br>But is this enough? If you&#x2019;re reading this now, my guess is that you know the answer: no way! I don&#x2019;t have to tell you it&#x2019;s not your parents&#x2019; and grandparents&#x2019; investment world. The plan used to be so simple: go to college, get a job, work your butt off, and then maybe get a better job with a bigger corporation. After that, the key was to find a way to add value, move up the ladder, invest in company stock, and retire with a pension. Remember pensions? A promise of a never-ending income for life? They&#x2019;ve become relics.<br> <br>You and I both know that world is over. We live longer now on less money. New technologies keep coming online, stoking a system that often seems designed to separate us from our money instead of helping us grow it. As I write these words, interest rates on our savings hover near zero, while the markets rise and fall like corks on the ocean. Meanwhile, we&#x2019;re faced with a financial system of limitless choices and mind-boggling complexity. Today there are more than 10,000 mutual funds, 1,400 different ETFs, and hundreds of global stock exchanges to choose from. It seems like every day we&#x2019;re pitched more and more complex investment &#x201c;instruments&#x201d; with an alphabet soup of acronyms: CDOs, REITs, MBSs, MLPs, CDSs, CETFs . . .<br> <br>WTF?<br> <br>How about HFT? That&#x2019;s short for high-frequency trading, where 50% to 70% of the tens of millions of trades that churn through the market each day are now generated by high-speed machines. What does that mean for you? It takes only a half second, or about 500 milliseconds, to click your mouse to complete your E*Trade order. In that short time, the big boys with the supercomputers will have bought and sold thousands of shares of the same stock hundreds of times over, making microprofits with each transaction. Michael Lewis, bestselling author of the HFT exposï¿½ Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt, told 60 Minutes, &#x201c;The United States stock market, the most iconic market in global capitalism, is rigged . . . by a combination of the stock exchanges, the big Wall Street banks, and high-frequency traders . . . They&#x2019;re able to identify your desire to buy shares in Microsoft and buy them in front of you and sell them back to you at a higher price!&#x201d; How fast are these guys? One HFT firm spent a quarter of a billion dollars to straighten the fiber-optic cables between Chicago and New York, reconstructing the landscape and literally terraforming the earth to shave 1.4 milliseconds off its transmission time! But even that&#x2019;s not fast enough. Some trades already take place in microseconds&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a millionth of a second. Soon HFT technology will allow these trades to happen in nanoseconds&#x2014;a billionth of a second. Meanwhile, they&#x2019;re laying cable on the ocean floor, and there&#x2019;s even talk of solar-powered drones acting as microwave relay stations to connect exchanges in New York and London.<br> <br>If all of this leaves you reeling, I&#x2019;m with you. What are your chances of competing with flying robots trading at the speed of light? Where do you turn to find a path through this high-tech, high-risk maze of choices?<br> <br>An expert is an ordinary man away from home giving advice.<br> <br>&#x2014;OSCAR WILDE<br> <br>The problem is, when it comes to money (and investing), everybody has an opinion. Everybody&#x2019;s got a tip. Everybody has an answer. But I&#x2019;ll give you a hint: they rarely have one that will really help you. Have you noticed how beliefs around money are like religion and politics? Conversations can get intense and emotional. Especially online, where people without any real knowledge or mastery will promote their own theories and criticize others&#x2019; strategies with such vehemence, even though they have no proven track record. It&#x2019;s like a psychologist on Prozac telling you how you can have a fulfilled life. Or an obese person telling you how to get thin and fit. I tend to separate pundits into those who talk the talk and those who walk the walk. I don&#x2019;t know about you, but I&#x2019;m sick and tired of hearing from all these &#x201c;experts&#x201d; who tell us what to do, but haven&#x2019;t produced results in their own lives.<br> <br>If you thought you were going to hear from another investment guru making crazy promises, you came to the wrong place. I&#x2019;ll leave that to the financial entertainers who scream at you about buying the hottest stock, or implore you to save your money and put it in some mythical mutual fund. You know the one, where they promise you&#x2019;ll continuously compound your money with 12% annual growth. They dole out advice that too often has no basis in reality, and often they don&#x2019;t even invest in the products they push. Some of them might sincerely think they&#x2019;re helping, but people can be sincere and be sincerely wrong.<br> <br>I want you to know I&#x2019;m not one of those &#x201c;positive thinkers&#x201d; who&#x2019;s going to pump you up with a false view of the world. I believe in intelligence. You have to see things as they really are but not worse than they are&#x2014;that view of life only gives you the excuse to do nothing. You may know me as the &#x201c;smiling guy with the big teeth&#x201d; on TV, but I&#x2019;m not here to tell you to do a bunch of affirmations&#x2014;I&#x2019;m the guy who&#x2019;s focused on helping you dig deep, solve real problems, and take your life to the next level.<br> <br>For 38 years, I&#x2019;ve been obsessed with finding strategies and tools that can immediately change the quality of people&#x2019;s lives. I have proven their effectiveness by producing measurable results where others have failed. So far I&#x2019;ve reached more than 50 million people from 100 different countries through my books, videos, and audio programs, and another 4 million in live events.<br> <br>What I&#x2019;ve known from the beginning is that success leaves clues. People who succeed at the highest level are not lucky; they&#x2019;re doing something differently than everyone else does. I&#x2019;m interested in those people: those who have a relentless hunger to learn and grow and achieve. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. I&#x2019;m not deluded. I&#x2019;m aware there are very few people in the world who are fit and healthy and who sustain it. Most people don&#x2019;t have decades of sustained love and passion in their intimate relationships, nor do they experience ongoing gratitude and joy. There are very few people who maximize their business opportunities. And there are even fewer who start with little or nothing and become financially free.<br> <br>But a few do! A few do have great relationships, great joy, great wealth, and endless gratitude. I have studied the few who do versus the many who talk. If you want to look for obstacles, what&#x2019;s wrong is always available. But so is what&#x2019;s right! I am a hunter of human excellence. I seek out those individuals who break the norms and demonstrate to all of us what&#x2019;s really possible. I learn what those few extraordinary individuals do that&#x2019;s different from everybody else, and then emulate them. I find out what works, and then I clarify it, simplify it, and systematize it in a way to help people move forward.<br> <br>Ever since the dark days of 2008, when the global financial system nearly melted down, I&#x2019;ve been obsessed with finding a way to help everyday people take control of their money and fight back against a system that&#x2019;s often been rigged against them. The fix has been in for years, and it hasn&#x2019;t gotten a whole lot better with all those so-called reforms on Capitol Hill. In some areas, it&#x2019;s gotten worse. To find answers, I interviewed 50 of the most brilliant, influential players in the world of money. In this book, you won&#x2019;t get talking heads, and you won&#x2019;t get my opinions, either. You&#x2019;ll hear it straight from the masters of the game: self-made billionaires, Nobel laureates, and financial titans. Here&#x2019;s just a sampling of a few of the masters of money that you will be learning from in the pages ahead:<br> <br>ï¿½ John C.

Subtitled Upon the Importance of Doing Nothing and Discussing Everything, the essay takes the form of a leisurely dialogue between two characters: Ernest, who insists upon Wilde&#x2019;s own belief in art&#x2019;s freedom from societal mandates and values, and a quizzical Gilbert. With his playwright&#x2019;s ear for dialogue, Wilde champions idleness and contemplation as prerequisites to artistic cultivation. Beyond the well-known dictum of art for art&#x2019;s sake, Wilde&#x2019;s originality lays argument for the equality of criticism and art. For him, criticism is not subject to the work of art, but can in fact precede it: the artist cannot create without engaging his or her critical faculties first. And, as Wilde writes, &#x201c;To the critic the work of art is simply a suggestion for a new work of his own.&#x201d; The field of art and criticism should be open to the free play of the mind, but Wilde plays seriously, even prophetically. Writing in 1891, he foresaw that criticism would have an increasingly important role as the need to make sense of what we see increases with the complexities of modern life. It is only the fine perception and explication of beauty, Wilde suggests, that will allow us to create meaning, joy, empathy, and peace out of the chaos of facts and reality.</p><p>Oscar Wilde (1854&#x2013;1900) was an Irish poet and playwright who became one of London&#x2019;s most popular writers in the early 1890s. Graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, and later Magdalen College, Oxford, Wilde embarked on a hugely successful lecture tour of America in 1882. Two early melodramatic tragedies, Vera; or, The Nihilists (1880) and The Duchess of Padua (1883), were written during these years, paving the way for later stage classics such as A Woman of No Importance (1893), An Ideal Husband (1895), and The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). Wilde also continued to write prose and criticism for popular daily newspapers such as The Pall Mall Gazette, as well as The Woman&#x2019;s World, a Victorian women&#x2019;s magazine that he edited between 1887 and 1889. Though often controversial, his flair for journalism and nose for scandal ensured these writings were widely read. His bold essays on aesthetic philosophy, published together in the collection Intentions (1891), were known for their wit and play with motif. Together with his plays and poems, these writings on art remain important and influential meditations of the nature of art criticism itself.</p><h2>Bestiary: Being an English Version of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Bodley 764</h2><p>Bestiaries are a particularly characteristic product of medieval England, and give a unique insight into the medieval mind. Richly illuminated and lavishly produced, they were luxury objects for noble families. Their three-fold purpose was to provide a natural history of birds, beasts and fishes, to draw moral examples from animal behaviour (the industrious bee, the stubborn ass), and to reveal a mystical meaning - the phoenix, for instance, as a symbol of Christ&#39;s resurrection. This Bestiary, MS Bodley 764, was produced around the middle of the thirteenth century and is of singular beauty and interest. The lively illustrations have the freedom and naturalistic quality of the later Gothic style, and make dazzling use of colour. This book reproduces the 136 illuminations to the same size and in the same place as the original manuscript, fitting the text around them. Richard Barber&#39;s translation from the original Latin is a delight to read, capturing both the serious intent of the manuscript and its charm. RICHARD BARBER has written many books on the history of and life in the middle ages, from his Somerset Maugham Award-winning The Knight and Chivalry, by way of biographies of Henry II and the Black Prince, to an anthology of Arthurian literature from England, France and Germany, Arthurian Legends, and an account of the historical Arthur, King Arthur: Hero and Legend.</p><p>RICHARD BARBER has written many books on the history of and life in the middle ages, from his Somerset Maugham Award-winning The Knight and Chivalry, by way of biographies of Henry II and the Black Prince, to an anthology of Arthurian literature from England, France and Germany, Arthurian Legends, and an account of the historical Arthur, King Arthur: Hero and Legend. His latest book is Myths and Legends of the British Isles, retellings of the foundation myths of Britain.The translation is pellucid, and the colourful late-gothic illustrations really delightful. Epic begets epic: stupendous and thought-provoking. FORTEAN TIMES An invaluable resource for readers and writers who aspire to understand how mediaeval men and women viewed the natural world, both actual and fantastical. HISTORICAL NOVELS REVIEW Excellent translation from the Latin original makes for fascinating reading about beasts, real and imaginary, of the medieval world. The most delightful picture-book about animals you&#39;ll ever see. EVENING STANDARD Hugely enjoyable, this English version of a 13th-century manuscript in the Bodleian Library offers every kind of beast... The illustrations are gorgeous and well reproduced. INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY</p><h2>The Art of Vinyasa: Awakening Body and Mind through the Practice of Ashtanga Yoga</h2><p><b>A radical presentation of the most rigorous form of contemporary yoga as meditation in motion.</b><br><i>The Art of Vinyasa</i> takes a unique look at Ashtanga yoga as meditation in motion that produces profound inner change. Two of the most well-respected teachers of the Ashtanga style of yoga, Richard Freeman and Mary Taylor, explore this rigorous practice not as a gymnastic feat, but as a meditative form. They reveal that doing the practice--and particularly the vinyasa, or the breath-synchonized movements--in such a deep and focused way allows practitioners to experience a profound awakening of the body and mind. It also develops an adaptable, flexible practice that can last a lifetime.<br>&nbsp;<br>Freeman and Taylor give an in-depth explanation of form, alignment, and anatomy, and how they work together in the practice. They also present a holistic approach to asana practice that includes an awareness of the subtle breath, and seamlessly merges yoga philosophy with practical technique.<br><br>Unlike other books on Ashtanga, <i>The Art of Vinyasa</i> does not follow the linear pattern of the sequences of postures that are the hallmark of Ashtanga yoga. Instead, it interlinks the eight limbs--<i>yama</i> and <i>niyama</i> (ethical practices); <i>asana</i> (postures); <i>pranayama </i>(breathing); <i>pratyahara </i>(nongrasping of the senses); <i>dharana</i> (concentration); <i>dhyana </i>(meditation); and <i>samadhi</i> (harmony, insight)--and shows how to establish an internally rooted yoga practice. <br><br> The book will be fully illustrated with fifty halftones by esteemed photographer and cinematographer Robert Muratore, along with thirty illustrations.</p><p>RICHARD FREEMAN has been a student and practitioner of yoga since 1968. He is one of the first students of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois to be certified in the Ashtanga tradition and teaches workshops and seminars on yoga asana, philosophy, pranayama, and meditation throughout the world. Richard draws from his background in philosophy and years of study in SE Asia to present an interlinking of traditions: Sanskrit studies, Hatha and Tantric Yoga, Sufism, and Buddhism, to bring out a direct experience of the internal methods and forms common to a broad spectrum of traditions. He is the author of <i>The Mirror of Yoga </i>and has also produced a number of videos and audio recordings on yoga, yoga philosophy, and chanting. When not traveling, he and his wife, Mary Taylor, split their time between Colorado and Thailand, where they also teach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MARY TAYLOR began studying yoga in 1972 and became an avid Ashtanga practitioner in 1987 after her first trip to Mysore, India, to study with Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. She is the cofounder, with Richard Freeman, of the Yoga Workshop, in Boulder, Colorado, which they started 1988. Mary travels and teaches throughout the world both with Richard and on her own. In addition to teaching Ashtanga yoga, Mary works closely with programs focus on bringing contemplative and yoga practices into the health care system for integrative therapies and self care, and she is active in Donna Karan's Urban Zen Foundation.&#x201c;More than just a book, this is a body of work that proves that yoga is a spiritual path, and that the body is not reducible to mere bones and muscles. I strongly recommend this book to all sincere students of yoga.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kino MacGregor, author of <i>The Power of</i> <i>Ashtanga Yoga<br></i><br> &#x201c;Mary Taylor and Richard Freeman are a dynamic duo merging their collective energies to create this powerful book. The pages are filled with their esoteric, practical, philosophical, visual and compassionate insights presenting yoga in its myriad layers of physical endeavor, intellectual pursuit, theoretical expression, and ultimately a spiritual path.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Swenson, author of <i>Ashtanga Yoga: The Practice Manual</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>The Art of Vinyasa</i> is nothing short of miraculous.&nbsp;Without the advantage of living with an enlightened master (I can&#x2019;t find one), this book is the next best teacher&#x2014;and I for one am deeply indebted.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rodney Yee, author of <i>Moving Toward Balance</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>The Art of Vinyasa</i> is an extraordinary book, illuminating the rare and precious path into the inner (and most powerful) dimensions of yoga practice. Study and savor it, contemplate it&#x2013;&#x2013;most importantly, unearth and practice the gems you find within its pages.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rod Stryker, founder of ParaYoga and author of <i>The Four Desires</i></p><h2>De Profundis: The Ballad of Reading Gaol and Other Writings</h2><p>De Profundis is Wilde&#39;s eloquent and bitter reproach from prison to his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. He contrasts his behaviour with that of his close friend Robert Ross who became Wilde&#39;s literary executor. The Ballad of Reading Gaol is a deeply moving and characteristically generous poem on the horrors of prison life, which was published anonymously in 1898. This collection also includes the essay The Soul of Man under Socialism and two of his Platonic dialogues, The Decay of Lying and The Critic as Artist.</p><p>Oscar Wilde was born on October 16, 1854, to the Irish nationalist and writer Speranza Wilde and the doctor William Wilde. After graduating from Oxford in 1878, Wilde moved to London, where he became notorious for his sharp wit and flamboyant style of dress. <br><br>Though he was publishing plays and poems throughout the 1880s, it wasn t until the late 1880s and early 1890s that his work started to be received positively. In 1895, Oscar Wilde was tried for homosexuality and was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Tragically, this downfall came at the height of his career, as his plays, <i>An Ideal Husband</i> and <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>, were playing to full houses in London. He was greatly weakened by the privations of prison life, and moved to Paris after his sentence. Wilde died in a hotel room, either of syphilis or complications from ear surgery, in Paris, on November 30, 1900.</p><h2>Modern Principles of Economics</h2><p>In a world full of economics blogs, Cowen and Tabarrok&#x2019;s Marginal Revolution (marginalrevolution.com) ranks is one of the Web&#x2019;s most popular and most respected.

How can one, for example, meaningfully present to a Western audience two radically different Yoruba works? The <i>ako</i> is a seated, life-like, life-sized, human-garbed burial effigy carved in wood which is painted to enhance its mimetic qualities&#x2014;a social and psychological reconstruction of the dead. The <i>aale</i> is a hanging, seemingly abstract sculptural construct made from a bit of red rag, a slipper, a metallic soup spoon, and some sticks&#x2014;a deterrent impregnated with <i>ase,</i> the catalytic life-force, to stop thieves and ward off unauthorized persons from one's property. Both of them could have been created around the same period, possibly even by the same artist. Quite often, our inadequate preparation to grapple with seeming incongruities of this kind has led to many misconceptions, bizarre conclusions, and at other times, brilliantly presented but untenable theories on African art. This simple comparison reveals how, in considering African art, conventional Western art historical assumptions of stylistic progression and individual artistic identity are called into question. To make any substantial progress in dealing with the problems of cross-cultural translation as it pertains to the study and presentation of African art, we must consider both perspectives: the indigenous as well as the Western. </p> <p> While it may have been useful to utilize only Western theoretical paradigms in the study of African art history and aesthetics in the early twentieth century, it has now become imperative to search carefully within the African cultures in which the art forms originate and to use internally derived conceptual frameworks in any critical discourse on African art. There are, however, difficulties in translating this theoretical position into practice. The study of African art, having begun within the discipline of anthropology, inherited some pertinent and vexing questions. Among these is the false assumption that Western scholars can fully understand and interpret the cultures of other peoples only by using their Western cultural notions, values, and standards&#x2014;a claim that cannot be divorced from a longstanding Western, imperialistic involvement in Africa. In the traditional discipline of art history, the importance of African art has hardly advanced beyond that of catalyst and sanction for the revolutionary goals of European artists such as Pablo Picasso at the beginning of the twentieth century. Thus, Roy Sieber, a leading scholar in African art, has noted that an insufficient understanding of African art has caused it "to fall prey to the taste of the twentieth century." </p> <p> In a bold and innovative manner, the authors of this textbook have taken a major step toward the goal of fashioning a new "lens"&#x2014;one which appreciates the methodology of the finest traditions in Western art history but which also recognizes the need to critically examine, modify, and expand. This will enable scholars to deal with the special challenges presented by the visual art traditions of predominantly non-writing, pre-colonial peoples of Africa. To illustrate my point, let us consider the question of anonymity in African art, a problem exacerbated by the fact that traditional African artists do not sign their works in the way artists in many contemporary Western societies do. Western audiences have become accustomed to appreciating and enjoying African works of art without knowing the names of their creators. Why should there be an interest in the issue of artists' identities now? Have we not read works by many scholars and even some "African art experts" premised on the notion that supposedly rigid African traditions are oblivious or even hostile to notions of individuality itself? The situation is complicated further when we consider how some art dealers and collectors view the issue of anonymity. A collector has been quoted as saying, "I am completely enchanted by the artist's anonymity. Not knowing the artist is something that gives me enormous pleasure. Once you hear who made it, it ceases to be primitive art." </p> <p> To continue with the example of the Yoruba of West Africa, research confirms that Yoruba people not only know the value of the authorship of works of art, but that they, in fact, celebrate it through the literary genre known as <i>oriki</i> (citation poetry). There are, of course, other appropriate traditional contexts and occasions in which an artist's name may be heard and used. They include child-naming, installation and burial ceremonies, blessing and healing rituals, and important family gatherings. The myth of anonymity was constructed and reinforced by many early Western researchers who believed that, although the artifacts and the traditional thought systems (their <i>raison d'etre</i>) belong to Africans, the interpretation of such works and the theorization of African art would always be a Western prerogative. Many scholars today (including the authors of this volume) are, however, more cautious about not repeating that same old error; i.e., believing that if the definitions of art or artistic procedures in other cultures do not take the forms with which we in the West are familiar, they must be lacking. </p> <p> In considering the question of anonymity, it is important to note some reasons that the Yoruba may not publicly or openly associate specific art forms with the names of their authors. Often, names given at birth are closely linked to and identified with the essence of one's personality and destiny called <i>ori inu</i> (inner spiritual head), which in Yoruba religious belief, determines a person's success or failure in this world and directs his or her actions. In Yoruba society, the act of calling out a person's given names generally functions to differentiate individuals. In their religious system, naming also is believed to have the ability to arouse or summon a person's spiritual essence and cause him or her to act according to the meaning of those given names or in some other way desired by the caller. This is the basis of the Yoruba saying, <i>oruko a maa ro'ni:</i> "one's name controls one's actions." For example, a name like Maboogunje is actually a plea, the full sentence being <i>"Ma(se) ba oogun je,"</i> the translation of which is "Do not render medication ineffective." </p> <p> Yoruba naming ceremonies and practices are among the most elaborate and sophisticated know anywhere. In addition to serving as identification, a name also incorporates elements of family history, beliefs, and the physical environment. With every naming, there begins a corresponding <i>oriki</i> (citation poetry), which grows with an individual's accomplishments. Thus, leaders, warriors, diviners, and other important personages, including artists, are easily identified by their <i>oriki,</i> which chronicles intricate oral portraits of all that is notable in their character and history. To illustrate, let me cite a part of the <i>oriki</i> of Olowe, one of the greatest traditional Yoruba sculptors of the twentieth century: </p> <p> <i>Olowe, oko mi kare o</i><br> Olowe, my excellent husband<br> <i>Aseri Agbaliju</i><br> Outstanding in war.<br> <i>Elemoso</i><br> <i>Elemoso</i> (Emissary of the king),<br> <i>Ajuru Agada</i><br> One with a mighty sword<br> <i>O sun on tegbetegbe</i><br> Handsome among his friends. </p> <p> <i>Elegbe bi oni sa</i><br> Outstanding among his peers.<br> <i>O p'uroko bi oni p'ugba</i><br> One who carves the hard wood of<br> the <i>iroko</i> tree as though it were as soft<br> as a calabash.<br> <i>O m'eo roko daun se ...</i><br> One who achieves fame with the<br> proceeds of his carving ...<br> <i>Ma a sin Olowe</i><br> I shall always adore you, Olowe.<br> <i>Olowe ke e p'uroko</i><br> Olowe, who carves <i>iroko</i> wood. </p> <p> <i>Olowe ke e sona</i><br> The master carver.<br> <i>O lo ule Ogoga</i><br> He went to the palace of Ogoga<br> <i>Odun merin lo se libe</i><br> And spent four years there.<br> <i>O sono un</i><br> He was carving there.<br> <i>Ku o ba ti de'le Ogoga</i><br> If you visit the Ogoga's palace, </p> <p> <i>Ku o ba ti d'Owo</i><br> And the one at Owo,<br> <i>Use oko mi e e libe</i><br> The work of my husband is there.<br> <i>Ku o ba ti de'kare</i><br> If you go to Ikare,<br> <i>Use oko mi i libe</i><br> The work of my husband is there.<br> <i>Ku o ba ti d'Igede</i><br> Pay a visit to Igede, </p> <p> <i>Use oko mi e e libe</i><br> You will find my husband's work<br> there.<br> <i>Ku o ba ti de Ukiti</i><br> The same thing at Ukiti.<br> <i>Use oko mi i libe</i><br> His work is there.<br> <i>Ku o li 0lowe l'Ogbagi</i><br> Mention Olowe's name at Ogbagi,<br> <i>L'Use</i><br> In Use too. </p> <p> <i>Use oko mi i libe</i><br> My husband's work can be found<br> <i>Ule Deji</i><br> In Deji's palace.<br> <i>Oko mi suse libe 1'Akure</i><br> My husband worked at Akure.<br> <i>Olowe suse l'Ogotun</i><br> My husband worked at Ogotun.<br> <i>Ikinniun</i><br> There was a carved lion </p> <p> <i>Kon gbelo silu Oyibo</i><br> That was taken to England.<br> <i>Owo e o lo mu se.</i><br> With his hands he made it. </p> <p> The <i>oriki</i> of Olowe was collected by John Pemberton III in 1988 from Oluju-ifun, one of Olowe's surviving wives, and has been found to be instrumental in reconstructing his life and work. </p> <p> Clearly, neither Yoruba culture nor the Yoruba system of storing and retrieving important information about their artists is impoverished. We do know, however, that artists may become vulnerable targets of unknown malevolent forces because of their profession and special position in the traditional community. For this reason, until relatively recent times, artists rarely revealed their full given names to strangers. It is, therefore, not surprising that many outstanding Yoruba artists whose works have been collected and studied by researchers have been identified in scholarly literature only by their nicknames or bynames such as, for example, Olowe Ise (meaning Olowe from the town of Ise);...</p></p><h2>The Emperor&#39;s New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Popular Science)</h2><p>For decades, proponents of artificial intelligence have argued that computers will soon be doing everything that a human mind can do. Admittedly, computers now play chess at the grandmaster level, but do they understand the game as we do? Can a computer eventually do everything a human mind can do?<br> In this absorbing and frequently contentious book, Roger Penrose--eminent physicist and winner, with Stephen Hawking, of the prestigious Wolf prize--puts forward his view that there are some facets of human thinking that can never be emulated by a machine. Penrose examines what physics and mathematics can tell us about how the mind works, what they can't, and what we need to know to understand the physical processes of consciousness.<br> He is among a growing number of physicists who think Einstein wasn't being stubborn when he said his "little finger" told him that quantum mechanics is incomplete, and he concludes that laws even deeper than quantum mechanics are essential for the operation of a mind. To support this contention, Penrose takes the reader on a dazzling tour that covers such topics as complex numbers, Turing machines, complexity theory, quantum mechanics, formal systems, Godel undecidability, phase spaces, Hilbert spaces, black holes, white holes, Hawking radiation, entropy, quasicrystals, the structure of the brain, and scores of other subjects.<br> <em>The Emperor's New Mind</em> will appeal to anyone with a serious interest in modern physics and its relation to philosophical issues, as well as to physicists, mathematicians, philosophers and those on either side of the AI debate.</p><p>Some love it, some hate it, but <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i>, physicist Roger Penrose's 1989 treatise attacking the foundations of strong artificial intelligence, is crucial for anyone interested in the history of thinking about AI and consciousness. Part survey of modern physics, part exploration of the philosophy of mind, the book is not for casual readers--though it's not overly technical, it rarely pauses to let the reader catch a breath. The overview of relativity and quantum theory, written by a master, is priceless and uncontroversial. The exploration of consciousness and AI, though, is generally considered as resting on shakier ground.<p> Penrose claims that there is an intimate, perhaps unknowable relation between quantum effects and our thinking, and ultimately derives his anti-AI stance from his proposition that some, if not all, of our thinking is non-algorithmic. Of course, these days we believe that there are other avenues to AI than traditional algorithmic programming; while he has been accused of setting up straw robots to knock down, this accusation is unfair. Little was then known about the power of neural networks and behavior-based robotics to simulate (and, some would say, <i>produce</i>) intelligent problem-solving behavior. Whether these tools will lead to strong AI is ultimately a question of belief, not proof, and <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> offers powerful arguments useful to believer and nonbeliever alike. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br><strong>Roger Penrose</strong> is the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford.

Drawing upon such diverse sources as theories of Benjamin, Adorno and Horckheimer, research on the Cuna Indians, and theories of colonialism and postcolonialism, Taussig shows that the history of mimesis is deeply tied to colonialism, and more specifically, to the colonial trade&#39;s construction of &#34;savages.&#34; With analysis that is vigorous, unorthodox, and often breathtaking, Taussig&#39;s cross-cultural discussion of mimesis deepens our understanding of the relationship between ethnography, racism and society.</p><p>In Mimesis and Alterity Taussig undertakes and eccentric history of the mimetic faculty. He moves easily from the nineteenth-century invention of mimetically capacious machines, such as the camera, backwards to the fable of colonial first contact&#39; alleged mimetic prowess of primitives, &#39; and then forward to contemporary time, when the idea of alterity is increasingly unstable. Utilizing anthropological theory, Taussig blends Latin American ethnography and colonial history with the insights of Walter Benjamin, Adorno and Horkheimer. Vigorous and unorthodox, Taussig&#39;s understanding of mimesis in different cultures deepens our meaning of ethnography, racism and society.Michael Taussig is 1933 Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University, USA, and is affiliated with the European Graduate School in Switzerland.</p><h2>Coding Projects in Scratch: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide to Coding Your Own Animations, Games, Simulations, a (Computer Coding for Kids)</h2><p><p>A straightforward, visual guide that shows young learners how to build their own computer projects using Scratch, a popular free programming language, using fun graphics and easy-to-follow instructions.</p><p>Kids can animate their favorite characters, build games to play with friends, create silly sound effects, and more with <i>Coding Projects in Scratch</i>.

Indeed it was with a Salon review that he made his literary debut: and it is significant that even at this early stage - in 1845 - he was already articulating the need for a painter who could depict the heroism of modern life. This he was to find in Constantin Guys, whom he later celebrated in the famous essay which provides the title-piece for this collection. Other material in this volume includes important and extended studies of three of Baudelaire&#39;s contemporary heroes - Delacroix, Poe and Wagner - and some more general articles, such as those on the theory and practice of caricature, and on what Baudelaire, with intentional scorn, called philosophic art. This last article develops views only touched on in Baudelaire&#39;s other writings. This volume is extensively illustrated with reproductions of works referred to in the text and otherwise relevant to it. It provides a survey of some of the most important ideas and individuals in the critical world of the great poet who has been called the father of modern art criticism.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)&#39;Mini-triumphs of contemporary design ... the words contained within these gem-like covers are lapidary as well.&#39; (Times Literary Supplement)</p><h2>Basic Conducting Techniques (6th Edition)</h2><p><p>Basic Conducting Techniques is a practical and innovative textbook that provides sound, time tested procedures and material for the beginning conducting class.

Combined, these occurrences brought about a "new war," as Churchill put it, with Japan and America deeply involved and Russia resurgent. This book, a truly international history, examines the momentous happenings of December 1941 from a variety of perspectives. It shows that their significance is clearly understood only when they are viewed together.</p></p><p><b>Evan Mawdsley</b> is honorary professorial research fellow, School of Humanities, University of Glasgow.

Tarot archetypes provide the reader with a window into present circumstances and future potential. But what if that window only opened up on a world that was white, European, and heterosexual? The interpretations of the tarot that have been passed down through tradition presuppose a commonality and normalcy among humanity. At the root of card meanings are archetypes that we accept without questioning. But at what point do archetypes become stereotypes?</p><p>Humanity is diverse--culturally, spiritually, sexually. Tarot has the power to serve a greater population, with the right keys to unlock the tarot's deeper meanings. In <i>Queering the Tarot</i>, Cassandra Snow deconstructs the meanings of the 78 cards explaining the ways in which each card might be interpreted against the norm. <i>Queering the Tarot</i> explores themes of sexuality, coming out, gender and gender-queering, sources of oppression and empowerment, and many other topics especially familiar to not-straight folks. Cassandra's identity-based approach speaks directly to those whose identity is either up in the air or consuming the forefront of their consciousness. It also speaks to those struggling with mental illness or the effects of trauma, all seekers looking for personal affirmation that who they are is okay.</p></p><p><b>Cassandra Snow</b> is a professional tarot card reader who teaches Queering the Tarot and Tarot for Beginners classes and coaches new and intermediate readers.

This superb collection contains excellent contemporary translations selected for their clarity and accessibility to today's reader, as well as an incisive introduction by Erich Segal, which reveals Plato's life and clarifies the philosophical issues examined in each dialogue. The first four dialogues recount the trial execution of Socrates--the extraordinary tragedy that changed Plato's life and so altered the course of Western though. Other dialogues create a rich tableau of intellectual life in Athens in the fourth century B.C., and examine the nature of virtue and love, knowledge and truth, society and the individual. Resounding with the humor and astounding brilliance of Socrates, the immortal iconoclast, these great works remain powerful, probing, and essential.Plato, with Socrates and Aristotle, is the founder of the Western intellectual tradition. Like his mentor Socrates, he was essentially a practical philosopher who found the abstract theory and visionary schemes of many contemporary thinkers misguided and sterile. He was born about 429 B.C. in Athens, the son of a prominent family that had long been involved in the city's politics. Extremely little survives of the history of Plato's youth, but he was raised in the shadow of the great Peloponnesian War, and its influence must have caused him to reject the political career open to him and to become a follower of the brilliantly unorthodox Socrates, the self-proclaimed "gadfly" of Athens.<br><br>Socrates' death in 399 B.C. turned Plato forever from politics, and in the next decade he wrote his first dialogues, among them Apology and Euthyphro. At age forty, Plato visited Italy and Syracuse, and upon his return he founded the Academy-Europe's first university-in a sacred park on the outskirts of Athens. The Academy survived for a millennium, finally closed by the emperor Justinian in A.D. 529. Plato hoped his school would train its pupils to carry out a life of service and to investigate questions of science and mathematics. Plato's old age was probably devoted to teaching and writing, he died in Athens in 348 B.C.</p><h2>What Your 5th Grader Needs to Know: Fundamentals of a Good Fifth-Grade Education (Core Knowledge Series)</h2><p>Grade by grade, these groundbreaking and successful books provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of a good education for first to sixth graders.<br><br>B &amp; W photographs, linecuts, and maps throughout; two-color printing.</p><p></p><h2>Study Guide for Options as a Strategic Investment 5th Edition</h2><p>This Study Guide for the Fifth Edition of <i>Options as a Strategic Investment </i>will help you maximize your understanding of options, thereby increasing your profits.</p><p><b>Lawrence G.

This book is West&#39;s exploration of Mexican history, religion, and culture - a work the author clearly conceived as a companion and sequel to her masterpiece about the Balkans, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (1941). Although West never brought Survivors to completion, she left behind a series of extensive drafts and revisions that Bernard Schweizer has meticulously assembled and edited. The result is a welcome addition to the Rebecca West canon - a compelling travel memoir/history comparable to her best work, and one certain to gain readers and critical acclaim.</p><p>Rebecca West (1892&#x2013;1983) wrote prolifically through most of the twentieth century. Her first novel, The Return of the Soldier (1918), is the only novel by a major woman writer to deal with World War I experiences. West wrote additional novels, journalistic studies of the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg, and a travel memoir/historical meditation on Yugoslavia, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, for which she is best known. Bernard Schweizer is assistant professor of English at Long Island University (Brooklyn). He is the author of Radicals on the Road: The Politics of British Travel Writing in the 1930s and Rebecca West: Heroism, Rebellion, and the Female Epic."[L]uscious reading. . . .

H. Lawrence called "the real stuff of tragedy." The heath's changing face mirrors the fortunes of the farmers, inn-keepers, sons, mothers, and lovers who populate the novel. The "native" is Clym Yeobright, who comes home from a cosmopolitan life in Paris. He; his cousin Thomasin; her fiancï¿½, Damon Wildeve; and the willful Eustacia Vye are the protagonists in a tale of doomed love, passion, alienation, and melancholy as Hardy brilliantly explores that theme so familiar throughout his fiction: the diabolical role of chance in determining the course of a life. <br><br>As Alexander Theroux asserts in his Introduction, Hardy was "committed to the deep expression of [nature's] ironic chaos and strange apathy, even hostility, toward man."</p><p>"This is the quality Hardy shares with the great writers...this setting behind the small action the terrific action of unfathomed nature."<br>--D. H. LawrenceThomas Hardy was born on June 2, 1840, in a thatched-roof cottage in upper Bockhampton, Dorset, England, a prophetic birthplace that lay in the center of 'Wessex,' the fictional region of southwest England which would serve as the backdrop for his novels. The eldest son of a prosperous builder and stonemason, Hardy was educated at the village school and apprenticed at the age of sixteen to local architect and church restorer John Hicks. In 1862 he went to London to pursue his architectural career; he also began writing at this time. Hardy returned to Dorset in 1867 to become assistant to John Hicks and wrote his first novel, <i>The Poor Man and the Lady,</i> of which only fragments remain. Although George Meredith, who was reader for Chapman &amp; Hall publishers, advised against its publication, he encouraged Hardy to keep writing, preferably a story with a more complicated plot. Over the next several years he produced three more novels: <i>Desperate Remedies</i> (1871) and <i>Under the Greenwood Tree</i> (1872) were published anonymously, but <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i> (1873) bore the author's name. <br><br>In November 1872, Leslie Stephen, the distinguished critic and editor, wrote to Hardy inviting him to contribute a novel for serialization in the Cornhill Magazine, a prestigious monthly that had published the work of such established writers as Anthony Trollope. Hardy accepted and in his letter to Stephen added that 'the chief characters would probably be a young woman-farmer, a shepherd, and a sergeant of cavalry.' He wrote <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> both in and out of doors at Bockhamptom as if possessed. 'Occasionally without a scrap of paper at the very moment when [I] felt volumes . . . [I] would use large dead leaves, white chips left by the woodcutters, or pieces of stone or slate that came to hand,' Hardy later recalled. Published anonymously in 1874, <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> sold out in just over two months and marked the turning point in Hardy's literary career. As Virginia Woolf later noted: 'The subject was right; the method was right; the poet and the countryman, the sensual man, the sombre reflective man, the man of learning, all enlisted to produce a book which, however fashions may chop and change, must hold its place among the great English novels.'<br> <br>The success of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> in 1874 encouraged Hardy to abandon architecture and devote himself entirely to the craft of fiction. His next novel, <i>The Hand of Ethelberta</i> (1876), also appeared in the Cornhill Magazine but did not repeat the success of its predecessor. In 1874 Hardy married Emma Lavinia Gifford, and the couple soon settled in an idyllic cottage overlooking the Dorset Stour, at Sturminster Newton, where Hardy wrote <i>The Return of the Native</i> (1878). In 1878 he moved to London. Although he became a well-known figure in literary circles and was considered a catch for hostesses, Hardy wrote three disappointing 'minor' novels during his years there: <i>The Trumpet-Major</i> (1880), <i>A Laodicean</i> (1881), and <i>Two on a Tower</i> (1882). This fallow period in his career seemed to lift in 1885 with his return to Dorset to live at Max Gate. Over the next three years he published <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i> (1886), which many regard as his greatest tragic novel, <i>The Woodlanders</i> (1887), and his first collection of short stories, <i>Wessex Tales</i> (1888). In 1891 <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> appeared, and in 1895 Hardy's final novel, <i>Jude the Obscure,</i> came out. The book sent shock waves of indignation rolling across Victorian England. It was denounced as pornography and subjected the author to an avalanche of abuse. Hardy's disgust at the public's reaction led him to announce in 1896 that he would never again write fiction. <br><br>During the remaining years of his life, Hardy devoted himself to poetry, publishing his first book of verse, <i>Wessex Poems,</i> in 1898. A second collection, Poems of the Past and Present, appeared in 1901. Over the next five years Hardy wrote <i>The Dynasts,</i> an epic drama about the Napoleonic War. In 1912 he made a final revision of his novels for the authoritative <i>Wessex Editions.</i> Hardy's wife died suddenly the same year. In February 1914 he married his longtime secretary, Florence Emily Dugdale. Over the next decade Hardy continued to write poetry and to work on his autobiography, The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, which was supposedly authored by his second wife and published posthumously. Thomas Hardy died in Dorset on January 11, 1928.

After conquering galaxies, Captain Invincible and his space-dog, Comet, prepare for an adventurous return to Earth in their spaceship Hawk. Using the Space Shaper panel, with its three-dimensional buttons that include a cube, a cone, and a pyramid, the captain and the pup wage a battle against a meteor shower, poison gas, a flying saucer, and a galactic beast. Just as the two are about to land safely, a beam of light floods their spaceship, and an open bedroom door reveals the true source of this journey-a child's late-night, wondrous imagination with the help of paper, scissors, and Scotch tape.

Their talents combine in this windswept collection of illustrated poems&#x2014;from &#x201c;The Negro Speaks of Rivers&#x201d; to &#x201c;Seascape,&#x201d; from &#x201c;Sea Calm&#x201d; to &#x201c;Sea Charm&#x201d;&#x2014; that celebrates all things oceanic.</p><p>Langston Hughes (1902&#x2013;1967) was born in Joplin, Missouri, and lived much of his life in Harlem, New York. As one America&#x2019;s most cherished chroniclers of the black experience, known for his work during the Harlem Renaissance, Hughes&#x2019;s work was constantly groundbreaking throughout his forty-six-year career. His poetry about the ocean and the symbolism that surrounds it stems from his travels through Africa and Europe working as a seaman.<br><br>Ashley Bryan grew up to the sound of his mother singing from morning to night, and he has shared the joy of song with children ever since. A beloved illustrator, he was recently named a Newbery Honoree for his picture book,&nbsp;<i>Freedom Over Me</i>.

He lives in Islesford, one of the Cranberry Isles off the coast of Maine.*"Readers don't have to have ever heard Bryan's unforgettable, theatrical recitation of "My People" or other Hughes poems to understand the depth of the artist's appreciation of and admiration for Hughes and his poetry: he opens the poems up visually here in the same way that he opens them auditorily when he performs them live. Like Hughes, Bryan, at 91, can also boast, 'I'm still pulling.'" -<i>Kirkus Reviews, </i>STARRED REVIEW</p><h2>Lessons from Turtle Island: Native Curriculum in Early Childhood Classrooms</h2><p>How do you help young children learn more about Native Americans than the cultural stereotypes found in children's books and in the media?<br><br><i>Lessons from Turtle Island</i> is the first complete guide to exploring Native American issues with children. The authors&#x2014;one Native, one white, both educators&#x2014;show ways to incorporate authentic learning experiences about Native Americans into your curriculum. This book is organized around five cross-cultural themes&#x2014;Children, Home, Families, Community, and the Environment. The authors present activities, from children's books they recommend, to develop skills in reading and writing, science, math, make-believe, art, and more. The book provides helpful guidelines and resource lists for selecting appropriate toys, children's books, music, and art, and also includes a family heritage project.<br><br>"[A] marvelous tool that should be in every American school."&#x2014;Joseph Bruchac, author of <i>Heart of a Chief and The Winter People</i><p></p><p><b>Guy W.

She is also the co-author of the &#34;More Than...Series&#34; and Lessons from Turtle Island: Native Curriculum in Early Childhood Classrooms.Using an accessible, nonjudgmental tone, the authors examine the depiction of Native American peoples in early childhood and primary programs and books. In five chapters, they concentrate on providing suggestions for appropriate literature, materials, and strategies for including contemporary Native cultures in the curriculum. Suggestions underscore the differences and similarities in people. For example, the unit on dance suggests teaming Cynthia Leitich Smith's Jingle Dancer with Karen Ackerman's Song and Dance Man or Kate Waters's Lion Dancer. The book also encourages adults to learn more about cultures so that they can understand the significance of traditions and artifacts before incorporating them into art projects. (It is very easy to introduce activities that mock the very traditions that well-meaning individuals attempt to honor.) Black-and-white photographs and line drawings help clarify the concepts and tasks. There is a short section on "problem" books like Susan Jeffers's Brother Eagle, Sister Sky. Team this valuable, informative resource with Beverly Slapin and Doris Seale's extensive (but somewhat dated) Through Indian Eyes: The Native Experience in Books for Children (Univ. of California, 1998) and Karen Harvey and Lisa Harjo's excellent How to Teach about American Indians: A Guide for the School Library Media Specialist (Greenwood, 1995).<br><i>Dona J.

His classic study of Enlightenment philosophy has not been surpassed. In portraying Enlightenment philosophy as a process, not a doctrine, Cassirer not only undermines all those caricatures of the Enlightenment that still flourish within and without the academy; he also shows the force it can have for renewing philosophy itself."<b>--Susan Neiman, author of <i>Moral Clarity</i></b></p><p>"Ernst Cassirer's <i>The Philosophy of the Enlightenment</i> is not only a brilliantly original work of history, it is itself a work of philosophy by one of the twentieth century's most interesting thinkers. Despite all that has been written on the Enlightenment since it first appeared in 1932, it remains unsurpassed."<b>--Anthony Pagden, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"This fine new re-edition of Ernst Cassirer's <i>The Philosophy of the Enlightenment</i> gives us two classics in one: Cassirer's own seminal statement of the evolution of eighteenth-century philosophy, and a concise and moving foreword by an intellectual sympathizer, Peter Gay, amongst the greatest historians of our time. Together the two men did more than virtually any other to define the Enlightenment for the twentieth century."<b>--Darrin M. McMahon, Florida State University</b></p><b>Ernst Cassirer</b> (1874-1945) was a German-Jewish philosopher who taught at several universities in Germany and the United States.

For the first time in a single volume, <em>The Essential David Bohm</em> offers a comprehensive overview of Bohm's original works from a non-technical perspective. Including three chapters of previously unpublished material, each reading has been selected to highlight some aspect of the implicate order process, and to provide an introduction to one of the most provocative thinkers of our time.</p><p>The late David Bohm, one of the greatest physicists and foremost thinkers this century, was Fellow of the Royal Society and Emeritus Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, University of London. Lee Nichol is a freelance writer and edited two works by David Bohm, On Dialogue (1996) and On Creativity (1998), both published by Routledge...."this is an excellent overview of Bohm's contributions to science, philosophy and society. The selections outline the foundations of Bohm's notion of "implicate order," drawing from theoretical physics, consciousness, perception, creativity and cosmology...The reader will appreciate Bohm's status as a provocative, diverse and (at times) somewhat unorthodox probing mind, concerned more with broad understanding than ego."

The text, the Wallam Olum, is a history of the Delaware (or Lenni Lenape) Indians. The book, originally written in pictographs, begins with a creation myth strikingly similar to that of Genesis, including corruption coming in the form of a snake and a flood. It goes on to tell of the Delaware's epic migration from Asia over the Bering Strait and then across the continent to the northeast, and concludes with the tribe's first encounter with Europeans in the 1500s. The history leads to the provocative question, "Friendly people, in great ships; who are they?" McCutchen then includes a historical fragment that brings the tribe's story into the 19th century. The text is presented in three forms: the original pictographs, the story in the Delaware's language, and the English translation. McCutchen puts the story in context through explanatory material. A foreword by the current chief of the tribe attests to the validity of McCutchen's fluid work.

It was the beginning of a long love affair with the city. <i>The Ancient Shore </i>collects the best of Hazzard&#x2019;s writings on Naples, along with a classic <i>New Yorker</i> essay by her late husband, Francis Steegmuller. For the pair, both insatiable readers, the Naples of Pliny, Gibbon, and Auden is constantly alive to them in the present.</p><p>With Hazzard as our guide, we encounter Henry James, Oscar Wilde, and of course Goethe, but Hazzard&#x2019;s concern is primarily with the Naples of our own time&#x2014;often violently unforgiving to innocent tourists, but able to transport the visitor who attends patiently to its rhythms and history. A town shadowed by both the symbol and the reality of Vesuvius can never fail to acknowledge the essential precariousness of life&#x2014;nor, as the lover of Naples discovers, the human compassion, generosity, and friendship that are necessary to sustain it.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated by photographs from such masters as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Herbert List, <i>The Ancient Shore </i>is a lyrical letter to a lifelong love: honest and clear-eyed, yet still fervently, endlessly enchanted.</p><p>&#x201c;Much larger than all its parts, this book does full justice to a place, and a time, where &#x2018;nothing was pristine, except the light.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Bookforum</i></p><p>&#x201c;Deep in the spell of Italy, Hazzard parses the difference between visiting and living and working in a foreign country.

[Her late husband Francis] Steegmuller, on the other hand, writes more personally, about a mugging he experienced in crime-prone Naples a few years back. But the two voices join in exquisite harmony to celebrate 'those of us who first came to Italy in the 1950s [and] were more than lucky; we were blessed.' Blessed, that is, with indelible impressions, for 'the day was an adventure of discoveries, mortal and immortal, inward or external, and occasionally somber.' A lovely book."

Using Muncie, Indiana&#x2015;the Lynds' now iconic Middletown&#x2015;as a touchstone, David Nye explores how electricity seeped into and redefined American culture. With an eye for telling details from archival sources and a broad understanding of cultural and social history, he creates a thought-provoking panorama of a technology fundamental to modern life. </p><p>Emphasizing the experiences of ordinary men and women rather than the lives of inventors and entrepreneurs, Nye treats electrification as a set of technical possibilities that were selectively adopted to create the streetcar suburb, the amusement park, the "Great White Way," the assembly line, the electrified home, and the industrialized farm. He shows how electricity touched every part of American life, how it became an extension of political ideologies, how it virtually created the image of the modern city, and how it even pervaded colloquial speech, confirming the values of high energy and speed that have become hallmarks of the twentieth century. He also pursues the social meaning of electrification as expressed in utopian ideas and exhibits at world's fairs, and explores the evocation of electrical landscapes in painting, literature, and photography. <i>Electrifying America</i> combines chronology and topicality to examine the major forms of light and power as they came into general use. It shows that in the city electrification promoted a more varied landscape and made possible new art forms and new consumption environments. In the factory, electricity permitted a complete redesign of the size and scale of operations, shifting power away from the shop floor to managers. Electrical appliances redefined domestic work and transformed the landscape of the home, while on the farm electricity laid the foundation for today's agribusiness.</p></p><p>David E. Nye is Senior Research Fellow at the Charles Babbage Institute and the History of Science and Technology program at the University of Minnesota and Professor Emeritus of American Studies at the University of Southern Denmark.

He was awarded the Leonardo da Vinci Medal in 2005 and was knighted by the Queen of Denmark in 2013.<p>David Nye casts his bright light on everything from assembly lines to washing machines, from the plummeting price of urban electricity to the usefulness of electric incubators in chicken farming...Mr. Nye succeeds not simply because he knows his technology, but also because be understands the complexity of American culture...[He] has the breadth of knowledge and the good sense to see the significance in paintings like Edward Hopper's 'Nighthawks'...and to weave such observations into the very armature of his argument that electricity transformed not only American life but the American self.</p>&#x2015;<b>John R.

Written in the 1930s and first discovered by the English-speaking world after the fall of communism in Hungary, Bï¿½nffy&#x2019;s novels were translated in the late 1990s to critical acclaim and now appear for the first time in hardcover.<br><br><i>They Were Counted, </i>the first novel in the trilogy, introduces us to a decadent, frivolous, and corrupt society unwittingly bent on its own destruction during the last years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Bï¿½nffy&#x2019;s lush depiction of an opulent lost paradise focuses on two upper-class cousins who couldn&#x2019;t be more different: Count Balint Abï¿½dy, a liberal politician who compassionately defends his homeland&#x2019;s downtrodden Romanian peasants, and his dissipated cousin Lï¿½szlï¿½, whose life is a whirl of parties, balls, hunting, and gambling. <i>They Were Counted</i> launches a story that brims with intrigues, love affairs, duels, murder, comedy, and tragedy, set against the rugged and ravishing scenery of Transylvania. Along with the other two novels in the trilogy&#x2014;<i>They Were Found Wanting </i>and <i>They Were Divided</i>&#x2014;it combines a Proustian nostalgia for the past, insight into a collapsing empire reminiscent of the work of Joseph Roth, and the drama and epic sweep of Tolstoy.</p><p><b>Count Miklï¿½s Bï¿½nffy</b> (1873-1950) was a Hungarian nobleman with extensive estates in Hungarian Transylvania (now Romania). He was the first patron of composer Bï¿½la Bartï¿½k and briefly Hungarian foreign minister after World War I. His castle and great library were deliberately destroyed by the retreating Nazis in 1944.<i>Excerpted from the Introduction</i><br><br>I<br><br>This great collection of three novels gives a fine picture of the life of the old Transylvania in the last days of the Habsburg Empire of Austria-Hungary before the disaster of 1914, when European civilization committed suicide. It was written after terrible events had darkened the life of postwar Hungary and Romania, but they would become darker. Had Bï¿½nffy written after the catastrophes of the 1940s, the tone of the book would surely have been even more sad.<br><br>Miklï¿½s Bï¿½nffy was a Hungarian, from one of the great families which had ruled Hungary for a thousand years. The name Baï¿½nff y probably derives from Denis, the viceroy (Ban) of Croatia in the thirteenth century:&nbsp; &#x2018;Ban fi&#x2019; indicated &#x2018;son of the Ban&#x2019;. Miklï¿½s Bï¿½nffy was related to all the aristocrats of the region. His wealth derived from great forests in Transylvania, a province which played an essential part in Hungary&#x2019;s history, but which was handed over unceremoniously to Romania in 1920&nbsp; in consequence of the Treaty of Trianon, one of the five main treaties at the end of the First World War. Bï¿½nffy&#x2019;s family palace in the city of Cluj-Napoca (Kolozsvaï¿½r to Hungarians) survives even now in the twenty-first century as a reminder of how elegantly these aristocrats of the old days of the Habsburg Empire lived. Another palace of the family is to be seen in Pest.<br><br>The Hungarians had always controlled Transylvania in the past, but they were by 1920&nbsp; in a slight minority in the region as a whole in comparison with the Romanians, many of whom, as the Hungarians pointed out, were recent immigrants there. Thus the Grands Cinq who were the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, the Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour (&#x2018;the most extraordinary objet d&#x2019;art our century has produced&#x2019;, according to Keynes), the French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, the Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando, and President Woodrow Wilson, the main peacemakers at Paris,<br>saw no reason to allow the region to remain as it had been.<br><br>&nbsp;The troubles of his country, Bï¿½nffy thought, had begun with the defeat by the Turks at Mohï¿½cs in 1526 . The last King of Hungary, Louis II, was killed with most of his court. That tragic defeat divided the land into three:&nbsp; in the conquered territory, all Hungarian political life came to an end, and the land was thereafter ruled by Turkish pashas;&nbsp; the nobles fled to the north, the west or eastwards to Transylvania;&nbsp; the poor people and the serfs mostly stayed where they were. The west and north came under Habsburg rule (Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, brother of Emperor Charles V, was elected King) and<br>that part of the land kept the name and constitution of the Kingdom of Hungary. It soon became much the same as the other provinces of the Habsburg monarchy. Like the Czechs, the Tyroleans and the German Austrians, the Hungarians had the power to raise taxes and make laws, but all important decisions regarding war and peace were made by the Emperor.<br><br>In contrast, the third part, Transylvania, developed what Bï¿½nffy called &#x2018;a living form of national consciousness&#x2019;, different from anywhere else. Its leading families did not support the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years&#x2019;War, and they even seem to have backed the Turks at the time of the siege of Vienna in 1683, continuing to do so in spite of the Christian liberation of Budapest in 1686 . Transylvanian princes such as John Zï¿½polya II, Sigismund Bï¿½thory, Stephen Bocskay, George Rï¿½kï¿½czi and above all Bethlen Gï¿½bor made the territory virtually independent. The Transylvanian hostility towards the Habsburgs and the Germans was thus deep-rooted. Of course, Transylvanians supported the Hungarian nationalist movement of the midnineteenth century which, after the rebellions of 1848 , led to the &#x2018;compromise&#x2019; of 1867 , establishing the kaiserlich und kï¿½niglich Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary.<br>II<br><br>Bï¿½nffy, who acquired both Romanian and Hungarian nationality in the 1920s, had been a diplomat and, in 1914, a soldier. He was a man of innumerable talents. A member of parliament from 1901 to 1904 and again from 1910 to 1918, he had also been a painter &#x2013; he painted an excellent self-portrait &#x2013; and,&nbsp; after leaving the Theresianum in Vienna (where in the novel his hero Baï¿½lint had lodged with his doomed cousin Lï¿½szlï¿½ ), he was for a time a pupil of the well-known painter of Budapest, Bertalan Szï¿½kely. He had enjoyed some success as a writer of plays and short stories. He had also studied law in Kolozsvï¿½r.<br><br>In these first years of the century, Bï¿½nffy seems primarily to have lived the happy life of an aristocrat of the old regime which is described so well in the Transylvanian trilogy: dancing in great houses, gambling and drinking in well-appointed clubs, reading in vast libraries &#x2018;lined with wooden bookcases almost to the ceiling, all curved and convoluted with elaborate carved and gilded decorations and divided by twisted columns of different precious woods&#x2019;;&nbsp; racing at great courses, taking part in magnificent battues&nbsp; in lovely valleys, sitting in the family box at the theatre;&nbsp; and riding in beautiful woods. &#x2018;The ball soon got under way, and the opening csardas was followed by a series of waltzes. Just as Laji Pongracz, the popular bandleader, swung his musicians into the new favourite, the &#x2018;&#x2018;Luxembourg Waltz&#x2019;&#x2019;, there was a new arrival . . .&#x2019;. The sentences tell us everything about that lost world. And, &#x2018;so the music went on. Song followed song.&#x2019; Perhaps Bï¿½nffy like Lï¿½szlï¿½ Gyerï¿½ffy in the novel would have worn a saffron yellow carnation on such occasions as these. How I regret not being able to go the Mardi Gras ball in the Assembly Rooms at the Casino in Kolozsvï¿½r. &#x2018;Some men&#x2019;, we hear in They Were Counted, &#x2018;still wore, for this occasion, the mulberry-coloured tailcoats and grey trousers that had been the fashion in the 1830s . . . It was also the tradition that even the oldest ladies turned out for Mardi Gras, dressed as if for an imperial reception, and wearing all the family jewels they could find a place for . . .&#x2019; <br><br>We hear, too, of such charming places as Countess Beredy&#x2019;s residence in Buda, &#x2018;an exquisite small palace built during the reign of the Empress Maria Theresa&#x2019;:<br>After mounting a rather narrow stairway the guests had to pass through a long gallery that overlooked the courtyard to reach a superb drawing-room whose windows opened over the fortifications of the old town . . . The principal [guest] was old Count Karoly Szelepcsenyi, an ex-minister, privy counsellor and friend of the Emperor . . . He possessed numerous decorations of which the most sought-after was the Order of the Golden Fleece . . . [which] must be worn at all times . . . Fanny&#x2019;s dinner parties were perfect in every respect . . . Every knife and fork and spoon was as heavy as a small cudgel and each piece was different from the others, all of them masterpieces . . . Fanny had made her husband buy [them] for her for a sum so huge that even he had blenched when it was mentioned to him . . . [They were] supposed to have been made for the Pompadour . . .<br>Sometimes Baï¿½lint would also be seen in Gerbeaud&#x2019;s cafï¿½ in Kolozsvï¿½r which is well described in They Were Divided:<br>Of course Gerbeaud&#x2019;s was very crowded. Every table was occupied and every chair taken, and in front of the long counter customers were standing two or three deep. Finally they found a place just beside the door, Countess Roza with her back to the wall and Balint on her right . . . Countess Roza did not mind at all. Smiling with good humour she sat there patiently until at last her coffee topped with whipped cream was brought her. Then, slowly stirring it, she watched the mob flow to and fro as the throng of society women almost fell over each other as they fought their way in and out . . . A tall young woman dressed in rust-colured linen appeared in the doorway. It was Adrienne.<br>Bï¿½lint, like Bï¿½nffy, is a high-minded landed proprietor. The&nbsp; poverty of the Romanian peasants in his district becomes a cause for him, and he takes Romanian lessons so that he can cope with the language of the sufferers. Bï¿½nffy did apparently have at least one duel, as Bï¿½lint does, over a trivial matter, but both certainly were deeply involved in politics. The early years of the century were full of positive signs. For example in 1906&nbsp; a universal suffrage bill was brought before the Hungarian parliament, threatening to break the preponderance of the Magyars and giving the possibility of a toehold to the Romanians. Then there were good poets such as Andrew Ady, popular and politically engaged. However, until 1914, Hungary remained essentially a feudal state ruled by a Magyar aristocracy of which Bï¿½nffy-Bï¿½lint was an outstanding member. There are some excellent descriptions of parliamentary life in the trilogy, including the scene in They Were Divided&nbsp; where the Prime Minister, Count Tisza, is shouted down after saying:&nbsp; &#x2018;Imust ask the honourable Members to abandon the course they have adopted, a course which is bringing our country to ruin.&#x2019;</p><h2>Divorce and Remarriage in the Church: Biblical Solutions for Pastoral Realities</h2><p>Will God allow me to divorce my abusive husband? Would it be a sin if I remarried? Divorce and remarriage are major pastoral issues facing every church. Yet when we turn to Scripture for guidance, we often hear conflicting messages about its teachings. David Instone-Brewer shows how, when properly understood, the New Testament provides faithful, realistic and wise guidance of crucial importance and practical help for the church today.</p><p>The <strong>Rev. Dr. David Instone-Brewer</strong> is a research fellow at Tyndale House, a research library in biblical studies located in Cambridge, England. He previously served as a Baptist minister. His previous publications include <em>Techniques and Assumptions in Jewish Exegesis Before 70 C.E., Divorce and Remarriage in the Bible</em> and <em>Traditions of the Rabbis from the Era of the New Testament.</em>"The next time I teach or counsel on divorce and remarriage I'm heading straight for this book. Not only does it make the biblical texts clear, it makes it clear how to teach them." (Dave Hansen, Kenwood Baptist Church, Cincinnati, Ohio)<br><br>"David Instone-Brewer knows the Scriptures, and the textual and cultural background to the Scriptures, as well as any biblical scholar in the world today. He combines this scholarship with a pastor's heart for people and a commitment to the church. Out of this powerful mix he has written an authoritative--perhaps <em>the </em>authoritative--treatment of divorce and remarriage in church life today. The crisp, breezy, accessible style of this book is a great strength. It is clearly written by a pastor for regular people. But underneath this accessibility is rock-solid scholarship. I think that <em>Divorce and Remarriage in the Church</em> will become an indispensable resource for both scholars and pastors in years to come, and has the promise of reforming church practices in thousands of congregations. I offer this book my highest endorsement." (David P. Gushee, University Fellow Graves Professor of Moral Philosophy, Union University; author of Getting Marriage Right)<br><br>"With fresh insights from ancient sources, Dr. David Instone-Brewer takes a deep yet engaging look at this timely topic. He writes with a scholar's mind and a pastor's heart. Clergy, counselors and church councils should read this book and then thoughtfully reflect upon his conclusions regarding a biblical perspective on divorce and remarriage. People who are thinking about marriage, divorce and remarriage should also read this book as it offers both hope and challenge." (Virginia Todd Holeman, Professor of Counseling, Asbury Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This is definitely the best and most compelling work I have read on the controversial subject of divorce and remarriage. Dr. Instone-Brewer marshals evidence from rabbinic literature, the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient texts to demonstrate the conclusion that the Bible permits (not 'commands' but 'permits') divorce on the grounds of adultery (or sexual immorality of any kind), neglect or abuse. Neglect includes desertion and the failure to provide food, clothing and conjugal love. The author is also very practical and helpful as he deals with specific real-life cases. I highly recommend this work." (Dr. Kenneth L. Barker, former secretary of the NIV Committee for Bible Translation)<br><br>"Based on scholarly research, this book offers pastors, counselors and laypersons a coherent biblical understanding of divorce and remarriage. A valuable aspect of the book is that it can be read at several levels--discerning readers will appreciate the wealth of evidence that allows them to reach their own conclusions, while those interested in 'the bottom line' will find the author's summary principles on divorce and remarriage most helpful. A summary chapter gives helpful suggestions and questions especially useful for small group discussions. I look forward to using this most excellent book in my D.Min. family ministry class." (Jack Balswick, Professor of Sociology and Family Development, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"David Instone-Brewer is one of today's foremost scholars on first-century Judaism and its bearing on the New Testament. In this book he blends his academic expertise with pastoral concern; he sorts through most of the toughest issues with both intellectual rigor and Christian compassion. His persuasive work on this subject has already had far-reaching influence." (Craig S. Keener, Professor of New Testament, Palmer Theological Seminary, Eastern University)</p><h2>Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry</h2><p>Presenting a wide-ranging selection of vital twentieth-century work, <em>Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry</em> contains more than 450 poems by 126 poets, beginning with Thomas Hardy and Gerard Manley Hopkins and ending with Catherine Walsh and Helen Macdonald. It features ample selections from canonical poets including W.H. Auden, Basil Bunting, T.S. Eliot, Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, Philip Larkin, D.H. Lawrence, Charlotte Mew, Hugh MacDiarmid, Wilfred Owen, Edith Sitwell, Stevie Smith, Dylan Thomas, Edward Thomas, and W.B. Yeats. At the same time, this volume challenges received accounts of modern and contemporary British and Irish poetry by presenting work from many poets--including Mary Butts, Brian Coffey, Nancy Cunard, Elizabeth Daryush, Ivor Gurney, F.R. Higgins, Mina Loy, Thomas MacGreevy, Joseph Gordon Macleod, Charles Madge, Clere Parsons, Lynette Roberts, John Rodker, and Sylvia Townsend Warner--who have never before been represented in this type of collection. <br> <em>Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry</em> covers many groups and movements--from the Georgians to the poets of the New Apocalypse and the Auden group and from the Movement to the New Generation--paying special attention to neglected modernist traditions. It presents a range of post-World War II exploratory poetry by writers including Tom Leonard, Tom Raworth, John Riley, and Maggie O'Sullivan alongside the work of more established figures like Thom Gunn, Tony Harrison, Paul Muldoon, and Craig Raine. It includes poetry by "Black British" writers including James Berry, Jean "Binta" Breeze, David Dabydeen, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Jackie Kay, E.A. Markham, and Grace Nichols, and feminist poetry by Fleur Adcock, Caroline Bergvall, Eavan Boland, Carol Ann Duffy, Denise Riley, Anna Wickham, and others. It also provides the complete texts or substantial excerpts of several important long poems. All of the poems are newly and thoroughly annotated, many for the first time. Each poet's selection begins with a critical introduction providing biographical and bibliographical information along with critical commentary. Ideal for general readers and for courses in modern and contemporary British and Irish poetry and literature, this anthology provides an unprecedented, inclusive portrait of the century's poetry in Britain and Ireland.<br></p><p>Keith Tuma is at Miami University."A wonderful feast of poets both well-known and half-forgotten; a scrupulous, beautiful gathering of the most vivid poetry in these great traditions."--Reginald Gibbons, Northwestern University<br><br>"A fine and fresh selection attractively presented with intelligent introductions and some unusual (and interesting) choices."--David Lampe, Buffalo State College<br><br>"Wide selection mindful of canonical and emergent voices.

These works of art have, in turn, fueled the imagination of fashion designers in the 20th and 21st centuries, yielding some of the most innovative creations in costume history. Connecting significant religious art and artifacts to their sartorial expressions, <i>Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination</i> provides a critical analysis of fashion&#x2019;s engagement with notions of the divine. Exploring fashion&#x2019;s complex and often controversial relationship with Catholicism, <i>Heavenly Bodies</i> probes what dress reveals about the state of religion and spirituality within contemporary culture, and how it may manifest&#x2014;or subvert&#x2014;Catholic values and ideology. Art objects, such as devotional paintings and altarpieces from The Met&#x2019;s collection, are presented alongside fashions from designers including Cristï¿½bal Balenciaga, Callot Soeurs, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, John Galliano, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Madame Grï¿½s, Christian Lacroix, Karl Lagerfeld, Jeanne Lanvin, Claire McCardell, Alexander McQueen, Thierry Mugler, Elsa Schiaparelli, and Gianni Versace. The volume also presents a selection of ecclesiastical vestments and accessories from the Vatican collection, many of which have not been published before.&nbsp;</p><p>This book is a brilliant exploration of fashion&#x2019;s complex engagement with the great art and artifacts influenced by Catholic faith and practice.<br> &nbsp;<b>Andrew Bolton</b> is Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><h2>Anton Chekhov&#39;s Selected Stories (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong>Fifty-two stories spanning Chekhov&#x2019;s career.</strong></p><em>Anton Chekhov&#x2019;s Selected Stories</em> contains a wide spectrum of classics and new favorites, including &#x201c;Ward No. 6,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Lady with the Little Dog,&#x201d; &#x201c;Anna on the Neck,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Name-Day Party,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Kiss,&#x201d; An Incident at Law,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Elements Most Often Found in Novels, Short Stories, Etc.&#x201d; This edition features twenty-five brand-new translations, commissioned expressly for this volume from Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, Peter Constantine, Rosamund Bartlett, Michael Henry Heim, among others.

Paul Getty Museum)</h2><p>In her first book, artist Sarah Perry has created twenty magical watercolors that are an open invitation to the imaginations of children. Beautifully produced in full color, these fantastic images conjure up a world of limitless possibilities where anything can happen: leaves turn into green fish...cats fly about on wings...and butterflies become a little girl&#39;s coat of many colors. Children of all ages will enjoy this book, the Getty Museum&#39;s first co-publication with the Children&#39;s Library Press of Venice, California.</p><p>A diving board to creative wordplay, the fascinating picture book <i>If...</i> offers a surrealistic view of the natural world. The two-page spreads present artful watercolors paired with such strange possibilities as "If zebras had stars and stripes...," "If the moon were square...," and "If worms had wheels...." Although some of the ideas and pictures are whimsical to the point of being downright creepy ("If caterpillars were toothpaste...," "If toes were teeth..."), the hypotheticals will surely inspire flights of fancy for readers of all ages. What could be more appealing for a 5-year-old than imagining the silliest suppositions and seeing them come to life in realistic paintings?<p> Sculptor Sarah Perry creates a world to make us stop and think. One of her best illustrations depicts a large, hairy warthog with a sparkling crown and the text, "If ugly were beautiful...." With every <i>if</i> idea, the author encourages the kind of mental double take that comes naturally for children.

Recursive Macroeconomic Theory provides both an introduction to recursive methods and advanced material, mixing tools and sample applications. The second edition contains substantial revisions to about half the original material, and extensive additional coverage appears in seven chapters new to this edition. The updated and added material covers exciting new topics that further illustrate the power and pervasiveness of recursive methods.Significant improvements to original chapters include a better treatment of the existence of recursive equilibria, an enhanced account of the supermartingale convergence theorem, and an extended treatment of an optimal taxation problem in an economy in which there are incomplete markets. Completely new coverage in the second edition includes an introductory chapter, which gives an overview of the themes uniting the diverse topic</p><p>"This revised edition is an excellent resource, both for those interested in state-of-the-art research in macroeconomics and for those anxious to learn the tools that are used to do it." <br>--Wouter J. Denhaan, Professor of Economics, London Business School <p>"*Recursive Macroeconomic Theory* thoroughly works through a wide variety of applications of recursive methods to the analysis of central themes in macroeconomics.

The book traces Jews' often tumultuous encounter with race from the 1870s through World War II, when they became vested as part of America's white mainstream and abandoned the practice of describing themselves in racial terms.</p><br><p> American Jewish history is often told as a story of quick and successful adaptation, but Goldstein demonstrates how the process of identifying as white Americans was an ambivalent one, filled with hard choices and conflicting emotions for Jewish immigrants and their children. Jews enjoyed a much greater level of social inclusion than African Americans, but their membership in white America was frequently made contingent on their conformity to prevailing racial mores and on the eradication of their perceived racial distinctiveness. While Jews consistently sought acceptance as whites, their tendency to express their own group bonds through the language of "race" led to deep misgivings about what was required of them.</p><br><p> Today, despite the great success Jews enjoy in the United States, they still struggle with the constraints of America's black-white dichotomy. <i>The Price of Whiteness</i> concludes that while Jews' status as white has opened many doors for them, it has also placed limits on their ability to assert themselves as a group apart.</p></p><p><p>"This is an outstanding book.

Seiter, Ph.D., CCA executive vice president and chief corrections officer, has been awarded the 2011 E.R. Cass Correctional Achievement Award by the American Correctional Association (ACA). This honor is awarded to only two people annually from the nation's oldest and highly regarded corrections organization, and represents the most distinguished recognition in the field. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Lannette C. Linthicum, director, Health Services Division, of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice was also honored. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The award is named after Edward R. Cass, whose career in corrections spanned more than half a century and who devoted more than 40 years to the ACA in the role of general secretary and, later, as president emeritus. According to the ACA, awardees of the E.R. Cass honor display "utmost devotion and distinction to the work and interests of the American Correctional Association" and demonstrate "service above and beyond the call of duty."&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Seiter was recognized due to his years of accomplishments and contribution to the field of corrections in many different ways and with several different agencies. He was a professor in the Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice at Saint Louis University from 2000 to 2005. During that time, he authored several articles and two textbooks on corrections, <i>Corrections: An Introduction</i> (2005/2008/2011) and <i>Correctional Administration: Integrating Theory and Practice</i> (2002/2011), both published by Pearson Prentice Hall. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Seiter worked for the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for over 20 years, serving as a warden of two facilities and as assistant director. With the BOP, he also was the chief operating officer of Federal Prison Industries. From 1983 to 1988, he also served as director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (DRC). In Ohio, he was a cabinet member and supervised an agency with 25,000 inmates and 8,000 staff. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Seiter was also the first director of the National Institute of Corrections' National Academy of Corrections in Boulder, Colo. And he joined CCA in his current role in January 2005, and has served in his current position since that time.&nbsp; In this role, he oversees the operation of 66 prisons holding 80,000 inmates with 17,000 staff.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"Dr. Rick Seiter has made an immeasurable and long-lasting imprint on corrections as we know it today," said Damon Hininger, CCA president and CEO. "His research, instruction and guidance have shaped the delivery, function and philosophy of corrections in our society."</p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>"Rick Seiter is known as a leader and administrator who supports the people who work for him, at all levels," said Art Leonardo, executive director, North American Association of Wardens and Superintendents (NAAWS). "His wardens are all enthusiastic supporters."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"Generations of young students and scholars have learned from his unique blend of policy, practice and attention to scientific data," said Joan Petersilia, Adelbert H. Sweet Professor of Law at Stanford Law School. "Quite frankly, I know of no other correctional administrator who has been able to successfully traverse correctional administration with academia and policy reform.

In ten eloquent and highly original explorations, she unfolds some of the ways this is done--by the inclusion of hiddenness, paradox, and surprise; by a perennial awareness of the place of uncertainty in our lives; by language's own acts of discovery; by the powers of image, statement, music, and feeling to enlarge in every direction. Closely reading poems by Dickinson, Bash&#x14d;, Szymborska, Cavafy, Heaney, Bishop, and Komunyakaa, among others, Hirshfield reveals how poetry's world-making takes place: word by charged word. By expanding what is imaginable and sayable, Hirshfield proposes, poems expand what is possible. <i>Ten Windows</i> restores us at every turn to a more precise, sensuous, and deepened experience of our shared humanity and of the seemingly limitless means by which that knowledge is both summoned and forged.</p></p><p><p><b>JANE HIRSHFIELD</b>&nbsp;is the author of eight books of poetry, including&nbsp;<i>The Beauty;</i>&nbsp;<i>Come, Thief; After;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Given Sugar, Given Salt.&nbsp;</i>She has edited and cotranslated four books presenting the work of poets from the past and is the author of two major collections of essays,&nbsp;<i>Nine Gates: Entering the Mind of Poetry</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Ten Windows: How Great Poems Transform the World.&nbsp;</i>Her books have been finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award and England&#x2019;s T. S. Eliot Prize; they have been named best books of the year by <i>The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, </i>Amazon,<i> </i>and <i>Financial Times; </i>and they have won the California Book Award, the Poetry Center Book Award, and the Donald Hall&#x2013;Jane Kenyon Prize in American Poetry. Hirshfield has received fellowships from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Academy of American Poets. Her poems appear in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Times Literary Supplement, Poetry, The New Republic,&nbsp;</i>and eight editions of&nbsp;<i>The Best American Poetry.</i>&nbsp;A resident of Northern California since 1974, she is a current chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.</p>Preface<br> &nbsp;<br> Good art is a truing of vision, in the way a saw is trued in the saw shop, to cut more cleanly. It is also a changing of vision. Entering a good poem, a person feels, tastes,&nbsp;hears, thinks, and sees in altered ways. Why ask art into a life at all, if not to be transformed and enlarged by its presence and mysterious means? Some hunger for more is in us&#x2014;more range, more depth, more feeling; more associative freedom, more beauty. More perplexity and more friction of interest. More prismatic grief and unstunted delight, more longing, more darkness. More saturation and permeability in knowing our own existence as also the existence of others. More capacity to be astonished. Art adds to the sum of the lives we would have, were it possible to live without it. And by changing selves, one by one, art changes also the outer world that selves create and share.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book continues the investigation begun in an earlier volume, &#x201c;Nine Gates: Entering the Mind of Poetry&#x201d;. The questions pursued by poems themselves are speckled, partial, and infinite. These books, though, pursue as well a single question: How do poems&#x2014;how does art&#x2014;work? Under that question, inevitably, is another: How do we? Inside the intricate clockworks of language and music, event and life, what allows and invites us to feel and know as we do, and then increase our feeling and knowing? Such a question cannot be answered. &#x201c;We&#x201d; are different, from one another and, moment by moment, from even ourselves. &#x201c;Art,&#x201d; too, is a word deceptively single of surface. Still, following this question for thirty years has given me pleasure, and some sense of approaching more nearly a destination whose center cannot ever be mapped or reached.<br> &nbsp;<br> Excerpted from Ten Windows by Jane Hirshfield.

He replied, &#x201c;A republic,&nbsp;<i>if you can keep it</i>.&#x201d; In this book, Justice Neil Gorsuch shares personal reflections, speeches, and essays that focus on the remarkable gift the framers left us in the Constitution.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Justice Gorsuch draws on his thirty-year career as a lawyer, teacher, judge, and justice to explore essential aspects our Constitution, its separation of powers, and the liberties it is designed to protect. He discusses the role of the judge in our constitutional order, and why he believes that originalism and textualism are the surest guides to interpreting our nation&#x2019;s founding documents and protecting our freedoms. He explains, too, the importance of affordable access to the courts in realizing the promise of equal justice under law&#x2014;while highlighting some of the challenges we face on this front today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Along the way, Justice Gorsuch reveals some of the events that have shaped his life and outlook, from his upbringing in Colorado to his Supreme Court confirmation process. And he emphasizes the pivotal roles of civic education, civil discourse, and mutual respect in maintaining a healthy republic.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>A Republic, If You Can Keep It</i>&nbsp;offers compelling insights into Justice Gorsuch&#x2019;s faith in America and its founding documents, his thoughts on our Constitution&#x2019;s design and the judge&#x2019;s place within it, and his beliefs about the responsibility each of us shares to sustain our distinctive republic of, by, and for &#x201c;We the People.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Neil M. Gorsuch</b> is an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. A Colorado native, he served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which is based in Colorado and hears appeals from six western states, before his appointment to the Supreme Court in April 2017. He has also worked as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice, where he helped oversee its civil litigating divisions; as a partner at a law firm; as a law professor; and as a law clerk for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy.1.<br><br>&#x201c;A Republic, If You Can Keep It&#x201d;<br><br>When you start a new job, your friends and family inevitably ask, &#x201c;Is it what you expected?&#x201d; The answer to that question is usually a mix of yes and no. It certainly has been for me.<br><br>The &#x201c;no&#x201d; part is pretty obvious. After all, no one can really expect or prepare for the job of Supreme Court justice. To serve the American people on our highest court is a humbling responsibility. In our history, only 114 men and women have done so.<br><br>The &#x201c;yes&#x201d; part may be a little less obvious. But in many ways the people and place are happily familiar. A surprising number of the Court&#x2019;s employees still remember me from my days as a law clerk years ago&#x2014;and all have gone out of their way to offer me a warm welcome. It is an honor to work with such dedicated public servants.<br><br>As it happens, too, three of the justices who served on the Court back then were still serving when I returned. Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom I clerked, is rightly regarded in our profession as a model of civility and judicial temperament. It was a special joy to be able to work by his side again&#x2014;and apparently the first time a law clerk and his former boss had the chance. When I was serving as Justice White&#x2019;s law clerk, he retired and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was appointed to serve as his successor. I remember the day my old boss passed along to his new colleague his law clerk manual, just in case she&#x2019;d find it helpful in setting up her office. Shortly after my confirmation, Justice Ginsburg returned that same document to me, along with many helpful updates she had added over the years. That was quite a moment for me. I also have a distinct memory from my time as a law clerk of watching Justice Clarence Thomas walk from his chambers to the Justices&#x2019; Conference Room to discuss cases. He was lugging a rolling book cart filled with briefs and binders and papers, his booming laugh filling the hallways. Fast-forward and, on one of my first days as a justice, I&#x2019;m walking to the Conference Room to discuss cases, and what do I see? Justice Thomas, with his book cart filled with briefs and binders and papers, and his same booming laugh.<br><br>More than all that, though, my new day job is a little like the one I shared for many years with wonderful colleagues on the court of appeals. Now, as then, the days are filled with reading briefs, listening to the arguments of lawyers, studying the law in solitude, and engaging with colleagues and law clerks. Each court, too, bears rites and rituals that serve to remind us of the seriousness of our common enterprise and the humanity of each person in it. When we conferred on cases at the Tenth Circuit, inevitably someone would volunteer to bring coffee, mugs would be passed around, and before getting down to the business of discussing cases we&#x2019;d begin by asking after one another&#x2019;s families. When a new member joined the court, we convened in a retreat to welcome the new judge, answer questions, express our support, and reflect on our aspirations as colleagues. Every other year, we gathered in conferences with the lawyers who regularly appeared before us to discuss the state of the circuit, along the way coming to appreciate one another more fully not just as professionals but as persons.<br><br>At the Supreme Court, the rituals are different but the point is the same. We eat lunch together regularly and share experiences and laughs along the way (Justice Stephen Breyer seems to possess an endless reservoir of knock-knock jokes). We flip burgers together at the Court&#x2019;s annual picnic and celebrate birthdays and the holidays with song (always enthusiastically if not always melodically). We welcome employees&#x2019; children in our chambers for trick-or-treating as they parade costumed around the building. Every justice at some point in the year sits down for lunch with the law clerks of every other justice. And whenever we gather for work, no matter how stressful the moment, each justice shakes the hand of every other justice. That practice dates back to the late nineteenth century and may seem a small gesture, but those thirty-six handshakes can break the ice and lead to kind words or a personal story. More recently, Justice William Rehnquist introduced an end-of-term party in which our law clerks put on a skit whose primary purpose seems to be to rib each of the justices good-naturedly. When he wrote to Chief Justice Warren Burger proposing the idea, Justice Rehnquist reportedly quipped, &#x201c;I should think we could have a very enjoyable evening out of it&#x201d;&#x2014;and we do. At the gathering, there&#x2019;s also a contest where the law clerks try their hand at trivia questions about the Court, its cases, and its history. In front of all the Court&#x2019;s employees, the Chief Justice grills the clerks with questions like &#x201c;What phrase is inscribed on the back of the Supreme Court Building?&#x201d; (&#x201c;Justice the Guardian of Liberty&#x201d;) and &#x201c;Where and when did the first meeting of the Supreme Court take place?&#x201d; (The Royal Exchange in New York City in February 1790). Simple traditions like these help renew our mutual respect and affection even, and especially, when we are unable to agree on the work at hand. They help ensure, too, that as a Court we never lose sight of our shared history.<br><br>My worry is that in our country today we sometimes overlook the importance of these kinds of bonds and traditions, and of the appreciation for civility and civics they instill. The problem can be summed up in a few numbers. According to polling by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, 60 percent of U.S. citizens would flunk the U.S. citizenship test. In fact, it seems only one state&#x2014;Vermont&#x2014;has a majority of people who could pass it (and even then, only with a D). A quarter of Americans don&#x2019;t know that freedom of speech is protected by the First Amendment. And, yes, it seems about 10 percent believe Judith Sheindlin serves on the Supreme Court. You may know her better as Judge Judy. Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of Americans believe the country is suffering from a crisis in civility. A quarter have reported enduring cyberbullying or incivility online. About the same percentage have transferred children to different schools because of incivility. At the same time, other people are actually calling for an end to civility. They say that civility is a coward&#x2019;s virtue and that more anger is needed&#x2014;that the stakes are too high and the ends justify the means.<br><br>But a government of and by the people rests on the belief that the people should and can govern themselves&#x2014;and do so in peace, with mutual respect. For all that to work, the people must have some idea how their own government operates&#x2014;its essential structure and promises, what it was intended to do and prohibited from doing. We must, as well, be able to talk to one another respectfully; debate and compromise; and strive to live together tolerantly. As Lincoln put it in far more trying times, &#x201c;[W]e must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.&#x201d; History teaches what happens when societies fail to pass on civic understandings and come to disdain civility: Civilization crumbles. Europe in the twentieth century had people, too, who, seeking to remake the social order in the vision of their ideology, thought the stakes of the day were too high to tolerate discourse and dissent. They also believed the ends justified the means, and it didn&#x2019;t end well.<br><br>None of this means, of course, that we are destined for the same path. The essential goodness of the American people is a profound reservoir of strength, and this nation has overcome much graver challenges time and again. But we should never ignore the fact that republics have a mixed record in the history books. Our blessings cannot be taken for granted and need constant tending. As Franklin said, we have been given a republic, if we can keep it.</p><h2>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p><p><b>&#xfeff;Introduction by George Saunders</b><br> <b>Commentary by Thomas Perry Sergeant, Bernard DeVoto, Clifton Fadiman, T. S. Eliot, and Leo Marx</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#xfeff;&#x201c;All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>,&#x201d; Ernest Hemingway wrote. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the best book we&#x2019;ve had.&#x201d; A complex masterpiece that spawned controversy right from the start (it was banished from the Concord library shelves in 1885), it is at heart a compelling adventure story. Huck, in flight from his murderous father, and Jim, in flight from slavery, pilot their raft through treacherous waters, surviving a crash with a steamboat and betrayal by rogues. As Norman Mailer has said, &#x201c;The mark of how good <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> has to be is that one can compare it to a number of our best modern American novels and it stands up page for page.&#x201d;</p></p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Stephen Dobyns explains the ability of poetry to communicate thoughts and feeling between the writer and the reader. Through essays on memory and metaphor, pacing, the intricacies of voice and tone, and appreciation of classic writers such as Chekhov and Rilke, Dobyns guides readers through poetry&#39;s mystery.</p><p>As its title implies, Stephen Dobyns&#39;s rigorous collection of essays about poetry celebrates Coleridge&#39;s dictum that poetry is the best words in the best order. Dobyns&#39;s probing examinations of the elements of poetry--metaphor, pacing, tone--and his study of the evolution of free verse are not for Sunday-sunset versifiers. They are strenuous, meaty, and wholly satisfying fare, intended for serious students of poetry. Dobyns, the author of eight volumes of poetry (and 17 novels), believes, like Baudelaire, that &#34;each poem ... has an optimum number of words [and] an optimum number of pieces of information ... and to go over or under even by one word weakens the whole.&#34; Poetry, he says, belongs to the reader, not the writer, and as readers, &#34;at the close of the poem, we must not only feel that our expectations have been met but that our lives have been increased, if only to a small degree.&#34; And, if that&#39;s not challenge enough for the writer, add to it &#34;that the conclusion of a given piece must appear both inevitable and surprising.&#34; The final third of the book comprises chapters on four writers, each of whom represents to Dobyns an ideal in poetry: Rainer Maria Rilke, who Dobyns says worked harder than any other poet to develop and change his work; Osip Mandelstam, an exemplar of moral centeredness; Anton Chekhov, for his sense of personal freedom; and Yannis Ritsos, for his &#34;sense of the mystery that surrounds us.&#34;In <i>Best Words, Best Order</i> Stephen Dobyns explains the mystery of the poet's work and the ability of poetry to communicate thought and feeling between the mind of the writer and the mind of the reader.</p><h2>Understanding Mass Incarceration: A People&#39;s Guide to the Key Civil Rights Struggle of Our Time</h2><p>We all know that orange is the new black and mass incarceration is the new Jim Crow, but how much do we actually know about the structure, goals, and impact of our criminal justice system? <i>Understanding Mass Incarceration</i> offers the first comprehensive overview of the incarceration apparatus put in place by the world&#x2019;s largest jailer: the United States.<br> <br>Drawing on a growing body of academic and professional work, <i>Understanding Mass Incarceration</i> describes in plain English the many competing theories of criminal justice&#x2014;from rehabilitation to retribution, from restorative justice to justice reinvestment. In a lively and accessible style, author James Kilgore illuminates the difference between prisons and jails, probation and parole, laying out key concepts and policies such as the War on Drugs, broken windows policing, three-strikes sentencing, the school-to-prison pipeline, recidivism, and prison privatization. Informed by the crucial lenses of race and gender, he addresses issues typically omitted from the discussion: the rapidly increasing incarceration of women, Latinos, and transgender people; the growing imprisonment of immigrants; and the devastating impact of mass incarceration on communities.<br> <br>Both field guide and primer, <i>Understanding Mass Incarceration</i> will be an essential resource for those engaged in criminal justice activism as well as those new to the subject.<br> <br></p><p><b>James Kilgore</b> is a formerly incarcerated person who currently teaches in the Center for African Studies at the University of Illinois.

V)</h2><p>Between 1961, when she gave her first talk at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston, and 1981, when she gave the last talk of her life in New Orleans, <b>Ayn Rand</b> spoke and wrote about topics as varied as education, medicine, Vietnam, and the death of <b>Marilyn Monroe</b>. In <b>The Voice of Reason</b>, these pieces, written in the last decades of Rand's life, are gathered in book form for the first time. With them are five essays by <b>Leonard Peikoff</b>, Rand's longtime associate and literary executor. The work concludes with Peikoff's epilogue, "My Thirty Years With Ayn Rand: An Intellectual Memoir," which answers the question "What was Ayn Rand really like?" Important reading for all thinking individuals, Rand's later writings reflect a life lived on principle, a probing mind, and a passionate intensity. This collection communicates not only Rand's singular worldview, but also the penetrating cultural and political analysis to which it gives rise.</p><p>Born February 2, 1905, <b>Ayn Rand</b> published her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, in 1936. <i>Anthem</i> followed in 1938. It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.Rand's strident right-wing rhetoric is on display in these posthumously collected essays. Upholding egoistic self-interest as the wellspring of capitalism, she derides liberals "crawling on their stomachs to Moscow" and targets "psychologizers" who excuse the behavior of "college-campus thugs" and criminals; in her estimation, the modern arts are a "sewer." Novelist ( Atlas Shrugged ) and self-styled Objectivist philosopher, Rand, who died in 1982, staunchly opposes a "mixed economy," a term which seems to stand for anything contrary to unregulated monopoly capitalism. Liberals should appreciate her diatribe against the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control and abortion. Her eulogy of Marilyn Monroe is sentimental and silly, while her argument to the effect that no psychologically balanced woman would want to be U.S. president is old-fashioned. In supplementary essays, Peikoff, an Objectivist follower of Rand, condemns the New Right's religious zeal and attacks socialized medicine. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Picasso and Truth: From Cubism to Guernica (The A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 58)</h2><p><p><b>A groundbreaking reassessment of Picasso by one of today's preeminent art historians</b></p><p><i>Picasso and Truth</i> offers a breathtaking and original new look at the most significant artist of the modern era. From Pablo Picasso's early <i>The Blue Room</i> to the later <i>Guernica</i>, eminent art historian T. J. Clark offers a striking reassessment of the artist's paintings from the 1920s and 1930s. Why was the space of a room so basic to Picasso's worldview? And what happened to his art when he began to feel that room-space become too confined&#x2015;too little exposed to the catastrophes of the twentieth century? Clark explores the role of space and the interior, and the battle between intimacy and monstrosity, in Picasso's art. Based on the A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts delivered at the National Gallery of Art, this lavishly illustrated volume remedies the biographical and idolatrous tendencies of most studies on Picasso, reasserting the structure and substance of the artist's work.</p><p>With compelling insight, Clark focuses on three central works&#x2015;the large-scale <i>Guitar and Mandolin on a Table</i> (1924), <i>The Three Dancers</i> (1925), and <i>The Painter and His Model</i> (1927)&#x2015;and explores Picasso's answer to Nietzsche's belief that the age-old commitment to truth was imploding in modern European culture. Masterful in its historical contextualization, <i>Picasso and Truth</i> rescues Picasso from the celebrity culture that trivializes his accomplishments and returns us to the tragic vision of his art&#x2015;humane and appalling, naï¿½ve and difficult, in mourning for a lost nineteenth century, yet utterly exposed to the hell of Europe between the wars.</p></p><p><p>"No art historian in our time has had a greater impact both within the field and beyond it than T. J. Clark. Everything he writes matters in the most fundamental way. His latest book, <i>Picasso and Truth</i>, is no exception--superbly observed, beautifully argued, a tour de force of looking, thinking, and writing."<b>--Michael Fried, author of <i>The Moment of Caravaggio</i></b></p><p>"This is the Picasso book for which we have all been waiting.

Today, more than ever, companies need to innovate to survive. But successful innovation--measured in dollars and cents--is a very hard target to hit.&nbsp; <br> Companies obsess over being creative and innovative and spend significant time and expense in designing and building products, yet struggle to monetize them: 72% of innovations fail to meet their financial targets--or fail entirely. Many companies have come to accept that a high failure rate, and the billions of dollars lost annually, is just the cost of doing business.<br> <b>Monetizing Innovations argues that this is tragic, wasteful, and wrong.</b><br> Radically improving the odds that your innovation will succeed is just a matter of removing the guesswork. That happens when you put customer demand and willingness to pay in the driver seat--when you design the product around the price. It's a new paradigm, and that opens the door to true game change: You can stop hoping to monetize, and start knowing that you will.<br> The authors at Simon Kucher know what they're talking about. As the world's premier pricing and monetization consulting services company, with 800 professionals in 30 cities around the globe, they have helped clients ranging from massive pharmaceuticals to fast-growing startups find success. In Monetizing Innovation, they distil the lessons of thirty years and over 10,000 projects into a practical, nine-step approach. Whether you are a CEO, executive leadership, or part of the team responsible for innovation and new product development, this book is for you, with special sections and checklist-driven summaries to make monetizing innovation part of your company's DNA. Illustrative case studies show how some of the world's best innovative companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Porsche, Optimizely, Draeger, Swarovski and big pharmaceutical companies have used principles outlined in this book.<br> A direct challenge to the status quo "spray and pray" style of innovation, Monetizing Innovation presents a practical approach that can be adopted by any organization, in any industry. Most monetizing innovation failure point home. Now more than ever, companies must rethink the practices that have lost countless billions of dollars. Monetizing Innovation presents a new way forward, and a clear promise: Go from hope to certainty.</p><p><b>A Revolutionary Challenge to Traditional Thinking About Innovation</b> <br>"In a world in which nearly three-quarters of all new products or services miss their revenue and profit goals, <i>Monetizing Innovation</i> should be required reading for all product and marketing leaders. I cannot overstate the importance of this groundbreaking new work."<br> <b>--Leela Srinivasan,</b> Chief Marketing Officer, Lever <br>"I must really compliment the authors on writing a first-rate book. They stress the importance of starting an innovation project with marketing and pricing in mind before building anything. More specifically, they show how companies need to carefully identify the target market and the price that the target customers would be willing to pay for the innovation, as if it were already available."<br> <b>--Philip Kotler,</b> S.C. Johnson &amp; Son Distinguished Professor of International Marketing, Kellogg Graduate School of Management and author of "<i>Winning at Innovation</i>" <br>"Madhavan Ramanujam is to monetization strategy what Bob Marley is to reggae music.

Nearly three out of four new products or services miss their revenue and profit goals -- or fail entirely. Companies embark on the long and costly journey of product development <i>hoping</i> they'll make money on their innovations, but not <i>knowing</i> if they will. <br>It doesn't have to be that way. <br>This book lays out nine rules for monetizing innovations, built on the lessons Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners has learned through conducting more than 10,000 projects on behalf of companies around the world. This deep body of knowledge allows the authors to identify issues and solutions in new product monetization. For example, while most of us believe that there are many reasons why new products might fail, <i>Monetizing Innovation</i> reveals that failures fall into four diagnosable categories: Feature Shocks, Minivations, Hidden Gems, and Undeads -- and that each is easily preventable. <br>Case studies showcase how some of the world's most innovative companies like Uber, Porsche, LinkedIn, Drï¿½ger, Optimizely, and Swarovski have used principles outlined in this book. <br>A direct challenge to the standard "spray and pray" style of innovation, <i>Monetizing Innovation</i> presents a practical approach that can be adopted by any organization, in any industry.

M. from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and has served on the editorial boards of such publications as <i>Leadership Magazine</i> and <i>Preaching Magazine</i>. An accomplished author of more than forty books -- including the popular Singer trilogy, <i>The Unchained Soul</i>, and <i>The Book of Jesus</i> -- Calvin Miller brings awe-inspiring artistry to the craft of writing.The latest sibling of Bill Bennett's <i>Book of Virtues</i> (1993) is one of the best and most focused. Like Bennett's big hit, it is a hefty compilation of notably high-quality writing whose thrust is, as Bennett's title suggests, virtuous. Editor Miller, a Baptist clergyman, says his anthology is intended to celebrate the greatness of Jesus Christ according to the Christian understanding of him. Miller draws from the works of well more than 100 writers, from the early Christian fathers to medieval and Renaissance voices, such as St. Francis and Shakespeare, down to moderns, who, besides Christian writers, include Ernest Hemingway, of all people. Of course, current evangelical stars Charles Colson and Max Lucado appear (though not controversial ones, such as Pat Robertson and James Dobson), and there are plenty of poems and hymn verses. The selections are arrayed in 10 topical sections, from "Jesus, Who He Was," through parts concentrating on his life and teachings, to the concluding readings on "Jesus, His Second Coming." A reverent job well done. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, 6th Edition (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)</h2><p>For close to sixty years Kate L.

The arrangement of the book remains the same. Chapters 13 and 14 show the ubiquity of computers. It is assumed that students now write their papers on a PC; typewriter users are referred back to the previous edition. The documentation chapters tell how to cite CD-ROM and online sources, and the bibliography at the end of the book has been updated. However, much of the book is unchanged.

On its publication in 1952, <i>Main Currents of Western Thought</i> did just that. &#x201c;As of the moment, intellectual history is both popular and suspect,&#x201d; Franklin Le Van Baumer wrote in his introduction, adding that it &#x201c;currently enjoys something like a vogue on both sides of the Atlantic.&#x201d; This same introduction, entitled &#x201c;Methodology and Interpretation,&#x201d; went far toward transforming a vogue into a respectable field of study by defining its goals and its methods, its problems and its pitfalls.<br>&nbsp;In the quarter of a century since its first appearance, <i>Main Currents</i> has remained unquestionably the leading reader in its field. The illuminating short essays that introduce sections and subsections are well known, but the continuing usefulness of any reader depends upon the quality of its selections. Baumer has sought out passages that best represent and illuminate the ideas and preoccupations of each age. He has found them in the works of the great, including Augustine, Aquinas, Dante, Luther, Newton, Voltaire, Darwin, Whitehead, and Freud. But he has also discovered telling statements in writings less widely known: Ramï¿½n Lull on chivalry (13th century), Henry Peacham on &#x201c;the complete gentleman&#x201d; and Leonard Busher on religious liberty (both 17th century), Louis-Renï¿½ de la Chalotais on education (18th century), Samuel Smiles on &#x201c;self-help&#x201d; (19th century) and Virgil Gheorgiu on mechanization (20th century).&nbsp;<br>Each of the previous editions of <i>Main Currents</i> has contained considerable new material. For this edition, the fourth, Baumer has rewritten the introductory essay to the section on &#x201c;the age of anxiety&#x201d; and the bibliographical note, and he has added thirteen new excerpts. Their authors range from Luther and Pascal to Bultmann, Bonhoeffer, and Heisenberg, enriching the earlier sections of the book and introducing three major figures of the 20th century.<br><br></p><p>In the quarter of a century since its first appearance, this book has remained unquestionably the leading reader in its field.

A mysterious shape-changing Confidence-Man approaches passengers on a Mississippi steamboat and, winning over the (not quite innocent) victims with his charm, urges them to implicitly trust in the cosmos, in nature, and even in human nature-with predictable results.<br><br><i>The Confidence-Man</i> represented a departure for Melville, a satirical and socially acute work that was to be a further step away from his sea novels. Yet it confused and angered reviewers who preferred to pigeonhole him as an adventure writer. Some have argued the book was a joke on the readers loyal to his sea stories, but if so, it backfired. Dismissed by critics as unreadable, and an undoubted financial failure, <i>The Confidence-Man</i>'s cold reception undermined Melville's belief in his ability to make a living writing works that were both popular and profound, and he soon gave up fiction. It was not until the mid-twentieth century that critics rediscovered the book and praised its wit, stunningly modern technique, and wry view that life may be just a cosmic con game.&#34;In &#34;The Confidence-Man,&#34; writes John Bryant in his Introduction, &#34;Melville found a way to render our tragic sense of self and society through the comic strategies of the confidence game. He puts the reader in the game to play its parts and to contemplate the inconsistencies of its knaves and fools.&#34; Set on a Mississippi steamer on April Fool&#39;s Day and populated by a series of shape-shifting con men, &#34;The Confidence-Man is a challenging metaphysical and ethical exploration of antebellum American society. Set from the first American edition of 1857, this Modern Library paperback includes an Appendix with Bryant&#39;s innovative &#34;fluid text&#34; analysis of early manuscript fragments from Melville&#39;s novel.</p><h2>Trisha&#39;s Table: My Feel-Good Favorites for a Balanced Life: A Cookbook</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<br><br>The country music superstar, Food Network standout, and bestselling author shows how delicious <i>and </i>wholesome dishes are part of a balanced lifestyle. <i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Trisha Yearwood is as much a force in the kitchen as she is on stage.

Benjamin Madley is the first historian to uncover the full extent of the slaughter, the involvement of state and federal officials, the taxpayer dollars that supported the violence, indigenous resistance, who did the killing, and why the killings ended. This deeply researched book is a comprehensive and chilling history of an American genocide.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Madley describes pre-contact California and precursors to the genocide before explaining how the Gold Rush stirred vigilante violence against California Indians. He narrates the rise of a state-sanctioned killing machine and the broad societal, judicial, and political support for genocide. Many participated: vigilantes, volunteer state militiamen, U.S. Army soldiers, U.S. congressmen, California governors, and others. The state and federal governments spent at least $1,700,000 on campaigns against California Indians. Besides evaluating government officials&#x2019; culpability, Madley considers why the slaughter constituted genocide and how other possible genocides within and beyond the Americas might be investigated using the methods presented in this groundbreaking book.</p><p><b>Benjamin Madley</b> is associate professor of history, University of California, Los Angeles, where he focuses on Native America, the United States, and genocide in world history.

The mass murders raise the question: Did they constitute genocide by official design? [Madley] thinks so. He thoroughly documents the extent of the killings and their horrific consequences. . . .

Written over the course of three decades and now collected in one volume, they trace a history of crucial artistic transitions, iterations, and paradigmatic shifts in the twentieth century, considering both the evolution and emergence of artistic forms and the specific historical moment in which they occurred. </p><p>Buchloh's subject matter ranges through various moments in the history of twentieth-century American and European art, from the moment of the <i>retour ï¿½ l'ordre</i> of 1915 to developments in the Soviet Union in the 1920s to the beginnings of Conceptual art in the late 1960s to the appropriation artists of the 1980s. He discusses conflicts resulting from historical repetitions (such as the monochrome and collage/montage aesthetics in the 1910s, 1950s, and 1980s), the emergence of crucial neo-avantgarde typologies, and the resuscitation of obsolete genres (including the portrait and landscape, revived by 1980s photography). Although these essays are less monographic than those in Buchloh's earlier collection, <i>Neo-Avantgarde and Culture Industry</i>, two essays in this volume are devoted to Marcel Broodthaers, whose work remains central to Buchloh's theoretical concerns. Engaging with both formal and historical paradigms, Buchloh situates himself productively between the force fields of formal theory and historical narrative, embracing the discrepancies and contradictions between them and within individual artistic trajectories.</p><p><b>Contents<br></b>Formalism and Historicity (1977) ï¿½ Marcel Broodthaers: Allegories of the Avant-Garde (1980) ï¿½ Figures of Authority, Ciphers of Regression: Notes on the Return of Representation in European Painting (1981) ï¿½ Allegorical Procedures: Appropriations and Montage in Contemporary Art (1982) ï¿½ The Museum Fictions of Marcel Broodthaers (1983) ï¿½ From Faktura to Factography (1984) ï¿½ Readymade, Objet Trouvï¿½, Idï¿½e Reï¿½ue (1985) ï¿½ The Primary Colors for the Second Time: A Paradigm Repetition of the Neo-Avantgarde (1986) ï¿½ Cold War Constructivism (1986) ï¿½ Conceptual Art 1962&#x2013;1969: From the Aesthetics of Administration to the Critique of Institutions (1989) ï¿½ Residual Resemblance: Three Notes on the Ends of Portraiture (1994) ï¿½ Sculpture: Publicity and the Poverty of Experience (1996)</p></p><p>Benjamin H.

In the ten years since the publication of his seminal Frames of Mind, thousands of educators, parents, and researchers have explored the practical implications of Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory&#x20ac;&#x201d;the powerful notion that there are separate human capacities, ranging from musical intelligence to the intelligence involved in understanding oneself. Multiple Intelligences: The Theory in Practice brings together previously published and original work by Gardner and his colleagues at Project Zero to provide a coherent picture of what we have learned about the educational applications of MI theory from projects in schools and formal research over the last decade.</p><p><b>Howard Gardner</b> is the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Professor in Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Among numerous honors, Gardner received a MacArthur Prize Fellowship in 1981. In 1990, he was the first American to receive the University of Louisville's Grawemeyer Award in education. In 2000, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.A potpourri of previously published articles and lectures, as well as chapters written specifically for this book--all explaining what the theory of multiple intelligences is and how it can be applied in today's schools. A decade ago, Gardner (Education/Harvard; The Unschooled Mind, 1991, etc.) put forward the idea that intelligence should be measured in more ways than through verbal and math tests that are standard for schools. He postulated seven basic ``intelligences,'' including language and logical-mathematical but also kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and spatial. Gardner gives all seven equal weight--but schools and testing institutions don't. Hence, children who are weak in language and math skills but strong in musical or interpersonal ``intelligence'' will suffer in the traditional classroom. Here, the author attempts to show how schools can address those differences so that students will be happier, more productive, and more able to cope with life. Except for a chapter on the Key School in Indianapolis, which has built its curriculum and method of teaching around multiple intelligences, teachers and administrators won't find a how-to on restructuring their classrooms here. Look to apprentice and museum programs and to the community for that, says Gardner (somewhat vaguely), leaving schools' options wide open. Strongest here are discussions of how to reframe testing and assessment methods and of how the limited view of intelligence can defeat both student and teacher. Research at Harvard's Project Zero (which Gardner directs) has developed new assessment materials, explained here, that help to measure all seven intelligences. Repetitious, thanks to its format; but even so a good introduction, along with Gardner's Frames of Mind (1983), to the theory of multiple intelligences. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

This edition, while retaining many of the features that have always made the Folger Shakespeare so attractive to the general reader, at the same time reflects these current ways of thinking about Shakespeare. For example, modern readers, actors, and teachers have become interested in the differences between, on the one hand, the early forms in which Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were first published and, on the other hand, the forms in which editors through the centuries have presented them. In response to this interest, we have based our edition on what we consider the best early printed version of a particular play (explaining our rationale in a section called &#x201c;An Introduction to This Text&#x201d;) and have marked our changes in the text&#x2014;unobtrusively, we hope, but in such a way that the curious reader can be aware that a change has been made and can consult the &#x201c;Textual Notes&#x201d; to discover what appeared in the early printed version.<br> <br>Current ways of looking at the plays are reflected in our brief introductions, in many of the commentary notes, in the annotated lists of &#x201c;Further Reading,&#x201d; and especially in each play&#x2019;s &#x201c;Modern Perspective,&#x201d; an essay written by an outstanding scholar who brings to the reader his or her fresh assessment of the play in the light of today&#x2019;s interests and concerns.<br> <br>As in the Folger Library General Reader&#x2019;s Shakespeare, which this edition replaces, we include explanatory notes designed to help make Shakespeare&#x2019;s language clearer to a modern reader, and we hyperlink notes to the lines that they explain. We also follow the earlier edition in including illustrations&#x2014;of objects, of clothing, of mythological figures&#x2014;from books and manuscripts in the Folger Library collection. We provide fresh accounts of the life of Shakespeare, of the publishing of his plays, and of the theaters in which his plays were performed, as well as an introduction to the text itself. We also include a section called &#x201c;Reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s Language,&#x201d; in which we try to help readers learn to &#x201c;break the code&#x201d; of Elizabethan poetic language.<br> <br>For each section of each volume, we are indebted to a host of generous experts and fellow scholars. The &#x201c;Reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s Language&#x201d; sections, for example, could not have been written had not Arthur King, of Brigham Young University, and Randal Robinson, author of Unlocking Shakespeare&#x2019;s Language, led the way in untangling Shakespearean language puzzles and shared their insights and methodologies generously with us. &#x201c;Shakespeare&#x2019;s Life&#x201d; profited by the careful reading given it by S.

Electric lighting, indoor plumbing, motor vehicles, air travel, and television transformed households and workplaces. But has that era of unprecedented growth come to an end? Weaving together a vivid narrative, historical anecdotes, and economic analysis, <i>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</i> challenges the view that economic growth will continue unabated, and demonstrates that the life-altering scale of innovations between 1870 and 1970 cannot be repeated. Robert Gordon contends that the nation's productivity growth will be further held back by the headwinds of rising inequality, stagnating education, an aging population, and the rising debt of college students and the federal government, and that we must find new solutions. A critical voice in the most pressing debates of our time, <i>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</i> is at once a tribute to a century of radical change and a harbinger of tougher times to come.</p></p><p><p>"The story of our standard of living is a vital part of American history and is well told in this fascinating book. Gordon provides colorful details and striking statistics about how the way we live has changed, and he asks whether we will live happily ever after. His answer will surprise you and challenge conventional assumptions about the future of economic growth. This book is a landmark--there is nothing else like it." <b>--Robert Solow, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"A towering achievement that will utterly transform the debate on U.S. productivity and growth. Robert Gordon chronicles the stunning swiftness with which American lives have advanced since 1870, and raises profound questions about whether we have benefitted from one-offs that cannot be repeated. Combining eloquent description with forceful and clear economic analysis, Gordon's voice is gripping and compelling. This is economic history at its best."<b>--Kenneth S. Rogoff, coauthor of <i>This Time Is Different</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</i> is a tour de force with an immensely important bottom line. It is packed, page after page, with insights and facts that every reader will find fascinating and new. A profound book that also happens to be a marvelous read."<b>--George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"Keynes dismissed concerns about economic trends by remarking that in the long run, we are all dead. Gordon turns this upside down by reminding us that we inherited somebody else's long run. If you care about the legacy we will leave future generations, read this richly detailed account of America's amazing century of growth."<b>--Paul Romer, New York University</b></p><p>"Robert Gordon has written the book on wealth--how Americans made it and enjoyed it in the past. If we're going to create more wealth in the future instead of arguing about dividing a shrinking pie, we have to read and understand this book."<b>--Peter Thiel, entrepreneur, investor, and author of <i>Zero to One</i></b></p><p>"This book is as important as it is unsettling. Gordon makes a compelling case that the golden age of growth is over. Anyone concerned with our economic future needs to carefully consider his argument."<b>--Lawrence Summers, Harvard University</b></p><p>"In <i>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</i>, Gordon looks at the evolution of consumption and the standard of living in the United States from the end of the Civil War to the present day. His work brims with the enthusiasm of discovery and is enriched by personal anecdotes and insights derived over a long and very productive career."<b>--Alexander J. Field, Santa Clara University</b></p><p>"<i>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</i> makes use of economic history to argue that Americans should expect the rate of economic growth to be, on average, slower in the future than it has been in the recent past. Gordon is the most important exponent of the pessimistic view working today and this is an exceptional book."<b>--Louis Cain, Loyola University Chicago</b></p><b>Robert J. Gordon</b> is professor in social sciences at Northwestern University. His books include Productivity Growth, Inflation, and Unemployment and Macroeconomics. Gordon was included in the 2016 Bloomberg list of the nation's most influential thinkers.</p><h2>The Cricket on the Hearth: and Other Christmas Stories (Dover Thrift Editions: Short Stories)</h2><p>With the publication of <i>A Christmas Carol, </i>Charles Dickens almost single-handedly created the genre of the "Christmas story." And while that beloved classic remains among the best known in the field, Dickens also wrote a number of other delightful tales associated with Yuletide. <br>This volume features three of the best. Combining realism with fantasy, and with kindness and affection for the poor a dominant theme, they include the title story, a charming tale of a pleasant and simple home life; "The Holly-Tree," a lighthearted story of love reclaimed in a quiet&nbsp;country inn; and "The Haunted House," an entertaining account of a belligerent ghost's effect on the lives of those with whom he shares a home. <br>Written with Dickens's familiar flair for characterization, comic incident, and the picturesque, these stories will delight readers with their unusual charms and nostalgic re-creation of Victorian Christmases past.</p><p>After a childhood blighted by poverty, commercial success came early to Charles Dickens (1812-70). By the age of 24, he was an international sensation whose new novels were eagerly anticipated. Two centuries later, Dickens&#39;s popularity endures as readers revel in the warm humanity and rollicking humor of his tales of self-discovery.(in full The Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home) Short tale written by Charles Dickens as a Christmas book for 1845 but published in 1846. The title creature is a sort of barometer of life at the home of John Peerybingle and his much younger wife Dot. When things go well, the cricket on the hearth chirps; it is silent when there is sorrow. Tackleton, a jealous old man, poisons John's mind about Dot, but the cricket through its supernatural powers restores John's confidence and all ends happily. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>God&#39;s Voice in the Stars: Zodiac Signs and Bible Truth</h2><p>What do horoscope signs have to do with the Bible?

Hardly, argues environmental lawyer turned rancher Nicolette Hahn Niman in her new book, <em>Defending Beef</em>.</p> <p>The public has long been led to believe that livestock, especially cattle, erode soils, pollute air and water, damage riparian areas, and decimate wildlife populations.</p> <p>In <em>Defending Beef</em>, Hahn Niman argues that cattle are not inherently bad for either the Earth or our own nutritional health. In fact, properly managed livestock play an essential role in maintaining grassland ecosystems by functioning as surrogates for herds of wild ruminants that once covered the globe. Hahn Niman argues that dispersed, grass-fed, small-scale farms can and should become the basis for American food production, replacing the factory farms that harm animals and the environment.</p> <p>The author&#x2015;a longtime vegetarian&#x2015;goes on to dispel popular myths about how eating beef is bad for our bodies. She methodically evaluates health claims made against beef, demonstrating that such claims have proven false.&nbsp; She shows how foods from cattle&#x2015;milk and meat, particularly when raised entirely on grass&#x2015;are healthful, extremely nutritious, and an irreplaceable part of the world&#x2019;s food system.</p> <p>Grounded in empirical scientific data and with living examples from around the world, <em>Defending Beef</em> builds a comprehensive argument that cattle can help to build carbon-sequestering soils to mitigate climate change, enhance biodiversity, help prevent desertification, and provide invaluable nutrition.</p> <p><em>Defending Beef</em> is simultaneously a book about big ideas and the author&#x2019;s own personal tale&#x2015;she starts out as a skeptical vegetarian and eventually becomes an enthusiastic participant in environmentally sustainable ranching.</p> <p>While no single book can definitively answer the thorny question of how to feed the Earth&#x2019;s growing population, <em>Defending Beef</em> makes the case that, whatever the world&#x2019;s future food system looks like, cattle and beef can and must be part of the solution.</p></p><p><p>Nicolette Hahn Niman is the author of <em>Defending Beef</em>. She previously served as senior attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance, running their campaign to reform the concentrated production of livestock and poultry. In recent years she has gained a national reputation as an advocate for sustainable food production and improved farm-animal welfare.&nbsp; She is the author of <em>Righteous Porkchop</em> (HarperCollins, 2009) and has written for numerous publications, including the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Huffington Post</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em> online. She lives on a ranch in Northern California, with her husband, Bill Niman, and their two sons.</p><p>"I have long wished for a single compilation with all the scientific evidence that counters the charges of the anti-beef propagandists. Well, now we have it. It&#x2019;s <em>Defending Beef, The Case for Sustainable Meat Production</em> by Nicolette Hahn Niman.&#x201d;<strong>--Allan Nation, The Stockman Grass Farmer</strong></p><br><br><p>"<em>Defending Beef</em> is full of important insights and information, things anyone who cares about food and agriculture, including vegetarians, ought to know.&#x201d;<strong>--Edward Behr, editor and publisher of <em>The Art of Eating</em></strong></p><br><br><p><em><strong>The Art of Eating-</strong></em></p> <p>"Serious thinking about food and agriculture fills <em>Defending Beef: The Case for Sustainable Meat Production</em> (Chelsea Green, softcover, $19.95).The beef Nicolette Hahn Niman defends is unprocessed, raised outdoors using humane methods on pasture or range. A lawyer, married to a rancher, she started with an anti-meat bias and remains a vegetarian (seemingly from habit). She answers criticism that cattle-raising contributes to desertification, world hunger, and global warming. She presents the ecological importance of trampling by hooves &#x2015; natural grasslands are a product of wild-animal grazing. The key for ranchers is well-timed pauses to let plants regrow. Problems come when grazing land is left to &#x201c;rest&#x201d; too long. Real environmental damage, she argues, comes from plowing up grasslands to plant crops. ... &nbsp;Most of her assertions come with references to scientific studies pro and con. Niman believes red meat is healthful, taking an Atkins-esque view that animal fat is not responsible for making people fat. In contrast to her own diet, she tentatively proposes: &#x201c;We should eat what our bodies evolved to eat&#x201d; &#x2015; mainly meat and wild plants. And she ties benign methods to the highest quality beef, giving her rancher husband&#x2019;s view that the best taste comes from the meat of British breeds; the cattle are at least two years old and fattened on the year&#x2019;s best grass. Beef is ideally a seasonal meat, she argues, although she doesn&#x2019;t believe it harms cattle to feed them some grain.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>"In response to the ecological objection that cattle production produces more harm than good, biologist, environmental lawyer, long-time vegetarian and rancher, Nicolette Hahn Niman presents the case that raising cattle can in fact have many environmental benefits. These benefits, she argues, include helping to sustain grassland as well as producing nutrient efficient products for human consumption. Using scientific data, Niman argues how small-scale, grass-fed cattle operations are actually part of a long-term sustainability solution.&#x201d;<strong>--<em>Food Tank</em>, "Top 10 Books About Food in 2014"</strong></p><br><br><p>"A longtime critic of industrial agriculture and a lawyer by training, Niman mounts a lawyerly case for pasture-based beef production. She does so from an interested position. She's the wife of Bill Niman, one of the nation's most celebrated grass-based ranchers. But critics who want to dismiss Niman's advocacy on economic-interest grounds have to grapple with the mountains of evidence she brings to bear. The main ecological question that haunts grass-fed beef involves climate change. Cows emit methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon, when they burp, which is often. But by grazing, they also promote healthy, flourishing grasslands, which suck carbon from the atmosphere and store it in soil. In doing so, they convert a wild vegetation that people can't digest into a highly nourishing foodstuff. So on balance, do cows contribute to or mitigate climate change?&nbsp; The conventional view holds that the burps win. Niman casts more than reasonable doubt on that verdict. Citing loads of research, she argues that enteric emissions (methane from burps) are likely overstated and can be curtailed by breeding and techniques like abundant salt licks, and more than offset by the carbon-gulping capacity of intensive grazing (where farmers run dense herds through a pasture for a short time, and then give the land plenty of time to recover). She also shows that healthy pastures also provide plenty of other benefits, including habitat for pollinating insects and birds, which are declining rapidly as industrial grain farming&#x2015;mostly for grain to feed confined animals&#x2015;expands.&#x201d;<strong>--Tom Philpott, <em>Mother Jones</em>, Best Food Books of 2014</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;[T]he former environmental lawyer and now rancher Nicolette Hahn Niman&nbsp;...&nbsp;has now collected her thoughts in the elegant, strongly argued&nbsp;<em>Defending Beef</em>.&#x201d;<strong>--Corby Kummer, <em>The Atlantic</em>, Best Food Books of 2014</strong></p><br><br><p><strong><em>The Los Angeles Times</em>-</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;If you are looking for a book to inspire fisticuffs at the Thanksgiving table, you've found it. Her "manifesto" calls for a revolutionized food system &#x2015; one that requires cows. ... One after another, Hahn Niman skewers the, ahem, sacred cows of the anti-meat orthodoxy. Eating meat causes world hunger? No, livestock are critical food (and cash) for 1 billion global poor, many living where plant crops cannot be grown. Deforestation? Forests are cleared primarily for soy, almost none of which goes to feed cows. Red meat and animal fat are the cause of the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease? The 1953 Keys study that spawned this belief actually showed no causation between the two and pushed us into the deadly grip of trans-fats and the true killer: sugar. Overgrazing ruined the American West? No, it was improper grazing and, in some cases, not enough cattle. ... She's not trying to change your mind; she's trying to save your world. And if you're an eater trying to pick your way through this divisive debate, you're cheering the information on every page.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>-</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Using a potent mix of scientific data and neoteric theories about health and environment, Ms. Niman makes a convincing case that grass-fed cattle should be a part of a sustainable food culture. If I were not already a consumer of grass-fed beef (I buy it frozen), I would be upon reading this book. ... The problems with beef today &#x2018;are problems of land management, water resources, pollution, animal welfare, and food safety,&#x2019; Ms. Niman writes. She honors the cattleman culture, hoping the industry will self-correct, and to that end she shares the techniques that her husband developed to produce great-tasting grass-fed beef. Some of the author&#x2019;s observations touch on larger topics, like the gross amount of food waste in this country (a whopping 50% of all food produced) and how our system of food subsidies &#x2018;leads us to eat an abundance of unhealthy foods.&#x2019; These problems actually suggest pathways by which you and I might drive change, but they are not explored here. That may be because &#x2018;Defending Beef&#x2019; is true to its title: It seeks to persuade, not inflame.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em></p> <p>"After learning from her rancher husband the benefits of raising and eating beef, Niman (<em>Righteous Porkchop</em>) delivers a head-on attack against everything negative that has been said about the cattle industry. An environmental lawyer and vegetarian, Niman is a force of nature when it comes to debunking the untruths about how raising beef effects global warming, the connection between eating beef and heart disease, and that eating beef is the reason Americans are fatter than ever. Reading Niman's pointed and convincing prose, like when she states: 'compared with other ways of producing food, the keeping of grazing livestock, when done appropriately, is the most environmentally benign,&#x2019; one can only imagine challenging her combination of intelligence, passion, and thoroughness. Despite the title, Niman isn't always on the defensive. In fact, she continually proposes ideas how to make meat production better by promoting the land- and animal-friendly practices of free-range, grass-fed ranching as a safer, more ecological, and healthier alternative to BigAg and industrial meat farming. Niman saves some of her most convincing and damning criticisms for her own vegetarianism as she demonstrates how raising livestock is not only a better option for the world's hungry masses, but also a better option for the planet's health. It sounds hard to believe, but Niman is almost impossible to disagree with.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Acres U.S.A.-</em></strong></p> <p>"The irony could not be more acute, for this vegetarian makes as forceful and compelling a case for rational livestock husbandry as could be imagined.&nbsp; ... A wealth of personal experience percolates through her case, giving it detail, color and emotional logic.&nbsp; ... The trick to telling this kind of story has to do with rendering reams of data into a relatively swift narrative without oversimplifying it. Whether telling the story of Allan Savory and mob grazing or recapping the findings of the late John Yudkin&#x2015;author of <em>Pure, White and Deadly</em> that fingered sugar for crimes against health 40 years ago&#x2015;Hahn Niman never misses a step. ...&nbsp;<em>Defending Beef</em> gives advocates of sustainable livestock a powerful weapon.&#x201d;<em><br> </em></p></p><h2>The Legal Environment of Business</h2><p>Now you can examine the practical structure and function of the legal system from the perspective of the professional non-lawyer with the popular THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT OF BUSINESS, 13E.

Unlike the others, however, this work is not a traditional commentary, which entails explaining the whole of each biblical book. Rather, the writers focus on "portions . . . that deal explicitly with female characters and symbols . . . and sections that bear upon the condition of women generally." Although the contributors share this goal, they take different paths. In addition to the commentary itself, there are helpful essays on feminist hermeneutics and daily life in biblical times. This commentary will raise eyebrows, and it will raise consciousness as well. It will not be well received in all quarters, but it is essential for those who are seriously interested in biblical and feminist studies.

Why is this the case, and what can school leaders do about it? In <i>The Color of Mind</i>, Derrick Darby and John L. Rury answer these pressing questions and show that we cannot make further progress in closing the achievement gap until we understand its racist origins.<br> <br> Telling the story of what they call the Color of Mind&#x2014;the idea that there are racial differences in intelligence, character, and behavior&#x2014;they show how philosophers, such as David Hume and Immanuel Kant, and American statesman Thomas Jefferson, contributed to the construction of this pernicious idea, how it influenced the nature of schooling and student achievement, and how voices of dissent such as Frederick Douglass, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and W. E. B. Du Bois debunked the Color of Mind and worked to undo its adverse impacts.<br> <br> Rejecting the view that racial differences in educational achievement are a product of innate or cultural differences, Darby and Rury uncover the historical interplay between ideas about race and American schooling, to show clearly that the racial achievement gap has been socially and institutionally constructed. School leaders striving to bring justice and dignity to American schools today must work to root out the systemic manifestations of these ideas within schools, while still doing what they can to mitigate the negative effects of poverty, segregation, inequality, and other external factors that adversely affect student achievement. While we cannot expect schools alone to solve these vexing social problems, we must demand that they address the dignitary injustices associated with how we track, discipline, and deal with special education that reinforce long-standing racist ideas. That is the only way to expel the Color of Mind from schools, close the racial achievement gap, and afford all children the dignity they deserve.</p></p><p><b>Derrick Darby</b> is professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan. He is the author of <i>Rights, Race, and Recognition</i>, and coeditor, with Tommie Shelby, of <i>Hip Hop and Philosophy: Rhyme 2 Reason</i>. <b>John L.

His other books include<i> Education and Social Change</i>, <i>The African American Struggle for Secondary Schooling</i> with Shirley A. Hill, and <i>Education and Women&#x2019;s Work</i>."There is, of course, no dearth of American scholarship on these themes, and the reader may be forgiven for thinking she will encounter little that isn&#x2019;t already known. Fortunately, however, the tack the authors take deviates in several important ways from most scholarship. . . . Given the book's title and theme, it is reasonable to assume that most readers will be those already convinced of its premises . . . .&nbsp;But it would be a shame if this book were read only by those already &#x2018;in the know&#x2019;.&nbsp;It would equally be a shame if the book's genealogical approach were to suggest to non-American readers that the Color of Mind is a uniquely American phenomenon. . . .&nbsp;though it was not the authors&#x2019; intention to shed light on institutionally racist thinking outside of the United States, for those with eyes to&nbsp;see, this book also issues an invitation to begin moving in that direction. It is long overdue." (<i>Theory and Research in Education</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Color of Mind</i> belongs to a series, History and Philosophy of Education, that aims to bring a humanities perspective to issues of education generally dominated by the social sciences. The book entirely vindicates the value of this approach. It brings an unaccustomed and quite valuable historical sweep to three issues: the development of the color of mind ideology, intellectual criticisms of that ideology, and the history of educational practices with respect to black Americans, including black-led educational institutions during the segregation era. Additionally, it brings a rich normative philosophical perspective to an area often hobbled by the value neutrality of the social sciences. . . . Darby and Rury&#x2019;s sweep of intellectual history here will be familiar to contemporary philosophers of race, but it is particularly illuminating in the context of education, showing that contemporary views of black students are deeply embedded in American history. . . .&nbsp;<i>The Color of Mind</i>&nbsp;will be an indispensable text for understanding educational racial injustice and contributing to initiatives to mitigate it." (<i>Educational Theory</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Achievement gap&#x2019;&#x2014;the phrase seems as normal or natural as anything we know about education. However, <i>The Color of Mind</i> meticulously documents the historical, social, political, and cultural context in which disparity was manufactured and is currently maintained. Everyone who cares about educational inequality should read this book.&#x201d; (Gloria J. Ladson-Billings, University of Wisconsin)<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;A mind is a terrible thing to waste&#x2019;&#x2014;but if the minds in question are black, then from the perspective of white racist educational policies, there&#x2019;s really nothing much to lose to begin with. In this powerful indictment of the long history of discriminatory practices in U.S. schools, Derrick Darby and John L. Rury demonstrate how traditional racist assumptions about the &#x2018;color of mind&#x2019; have systematically denied black students equal dignity and respect, and created the longstanding racial achievement gap in education. They demand corrective educational justice&#x2014;a demand every decent American should support.&#x201d; (Charles W. Mills, Graduate Center, City University of New York)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Color of Mind </i>is timely intervention into debates and discourses about the relationship between race, justice, and American education. From philosophy it offers a useful genealogy of the ethics of white supremacy and its impact on mutual racial respect; from history it offers a lean and direct account of the development of not only education policy but also the background conditions that preempted certain policies while making others possible. The authors have done a remarkable thing &#x2013; they have made the hard work of pairing conceptual and historical work on an issue and topic that has been at the center of American debates for more than a century look easy and effortless to read.&#x201d; (Christopher J. Lebron, Johns Hopkins University)<br><br>"<i>The Color of Mind&nbsp;</i>insists that no educational reform can succeed without teachers and school leaders knowing that black children were never supposed to learn or achieve by the same standards of their white counterparts. This pernicious idea and practice is at the root of today&#x2019;s black-white achievement gap. Knowing this history is the first and most consequential step towards ensuring that every school respects the dignity of black lives and black minds. Then comes the obvious, as this brilliant work shows: dismantling every policy of racially disparate tracking, disciplining or special education if real justice is ever to be achieved." (Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America)</p><h2>Sex and Race, Volume 1: Negro-Caucasian Mixing in All Ages and All Lands &#x2015; The Old World</h2><p>In the Sex and Race series, first published in the 1940s, historian Joel Augustus Rogers questioned the concept of race, the origins of racial differentiation, and the root of the "color problem." Rogers surmised that a large percentage of ethnic differences are the result of sociological factors and in these volumes he gathered what he called "the bran of history"&#x2015;the uncollected, unexamined history of black people&#x2015;in the hope that these neglected parts of history would become part of the mainstream body of Western history. Drawing on a vast amount of research, Rogers was attempting to point out the absurdity of racial divisions. Indeed his belief in one race&#x2015;humanity&#x2015;precluded the idea of several different ethnic races. The series marshals the data he had collected as evidence to prove his underlying humanistic thesis: that people were one large family without racial boundaries. Self-trained and self-published, Rogers and his work were immensely popular and influential during his day, even cited by Malcolm X. The books are presented here in their original editions.</p><p>JOEL AUGUSTUS ROGERS (September 6, 1880&#x2013;;March 26, 1966) was a Jamaican-American author, journalist, and historian who contributed to the history of Africa and the African diaspora, especially the history of African Americans in the United States. His research spanned the academic fields of history, sociology and anthropology. He challenged prevailing ideas about race, demonstrated the connections between civilizations, and traced African achievements. He was one of the greatest popularizers of African history in the twentieth century. Rogers addresses issues such as the lack of scientific support for the idea of race, the lack of black history being told from a black person's perspective, and the fact of intermarriage and unions among peoples throughout history. A respected historian and gifted lecturer, Rogers was a close personal friend of the Harlem-based intellectual and activist Hubert Harrison. In the 1920s, Rogers worked as a journalist on the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Enterprise, and he served as the first black foreign correspondent from the United States.&#x201c;No man living has revealed so many important facts about the Negro as Rogers.&#x201d;--W.E.B.

Baum is a must-read for adults and children alike. Follow the yellow brick road! Dorothy thinks she is lost forever when a terrifying tornado crashes through Kansas and whisks her and her dog, Toto, far away to the magical land of Oz. To get home Dorothy must follow the yellow brick road to Emerald City and find the wonderfully mysterious Wizard of Oz. Together with her companions the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion whom she meets on the way, Dorothy embarks on a strange and enchanting adventure. Frank L. Baum (1856-1919) was born in New York. He enjoyed making up stories, particularly for his own children. The Wizard of Oz, based on their favourite bedtime story about a land of Oz, was published in 1900 and it immediately became a huge international success.

W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow. The characters have a poignance and oddity that escaped the makers of the Oz movie.<p>The Wizard of Oz is a beloved American classic.&nbsp; This edition, with fine illustrations from internationally acclaimed artist Lizbeth Zwerger, has been reformatted as a readaloud edition.</p></p><h2>Printer&#39;s Error: Irreverent Stories from Book History</h2><p><p>A funny and entertaining history of printed books as told through absurd moments in the lives of authors and printers, collected by television&#x2019;s favorite rare-book expert from HISTORY&#x2019;s hit series <em>Pawn Stars.</em></p><p>Since the Gutenberg Bible first went on sale in 1455, printing has been viewed as one of the highest achievements of human innovation. But the march of progress hasn&#x2019;t been smooth; downright bizarre is more like it. Printer&#x2019;s Error chronicles some of the strangest and most humorous episodes in the history of Western printing, and makes clear that we&#x2019;ve succeeded despite ourselves. Rare-book expert Rebecca Romney and author J. P. Romney take us from monasteries and museums to auction houses and libraries to introduce curious episodes in the history of print that have had a profound impact on our world.</p><p>Take, for example, the Gutenberg Bible. While the book is regarded as the first printed work in the Western world, Gutenberg&#x2019;s name doesn&#x2019;t appear anywhere on it. Today, Johannes Gutenberg is recognized as the father of Western printing. But for the first few hundred years after the invention of the printing press, no one knew who printed the first book. This long-standing mystery took researchers down a labyrinth of ancient archives and libraries, and unearthed surprising details, such as the fact that Gutenberg&#x2019;s financier sued him, repossessed his printing equipment, and started his own printing business afterward. Eventually the first printed book was tracked to the library of Cardinal Mazarin in France, and Gutenberg&#x2019;s forty-two-line Bible was finally credited to him, thus ensuring Gutenberg&#x2019;s name would be remembered by middle-school students worldwide.</p><p>Like the works of Sarah Vowell, John Hodgman, and Ken Jennings, <em>Printer&#x2019;s Error</em> is a rollicking ride through the annals of time and the printed word.</p></p><p><p>Print history, like any history, is full of strange people and goings-on. The road paved by our civilization&#x2019;s best books is a long and noble one, but it is also lined with unexpected potholes and sharp turns into what-the-hell-is-going-on-here territory. Illustrators talking to ghosts, maps bringing countries to their knees, Shakespeare writing awful plays, and Charles Dickens branding America a nation of filthy literary thieves all serve as back alleys into which the authors could descend. Correction: into which the authors did descend.</p><p>Consider that today a Gutenberg Bible is the Holy Grail of book collecting. But that wasn&#x2019;t always so. James Lennox, a New York millionaire, sent an agent to bid on his behalf at a London auction in 1847. At that point, no one had ever paid more than ï¿½215 for a Gutenberg Bible. His agent became embroiled in a bidding war and when the dust settled, Lennox was on the hook for an eye-popping ï¿½500. Lennox was so angry about the exorbitant sticker price that he flatly refused to pay it. Eventually he came around, which was clearly the right choice, since a Gutenberg Bible would sell for tens of millions of dollars today.</p><p>Among the many other tales told in <em>Printer&#x2019;s Error</em> are the history of the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; versions of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, including a Hamlet who sounds more like a drunken pirate than a prince, and the fate of William Tyndale&#x2014;who made the Holy Bible accessible to countless worshippers&#x2014;who was also burned at the stake for heresy.</p><p>Rebecca Romney&#x2019;s appearances on the History Channel&#x2019;s <em>Pawn Stars</em> have made her the country&#x2019;s most recognizable rare book dealer. In her career, she has sold single volumes for $500,000, books from the libraries of Isaac Newton and Queen Elizabeth I, and more than one Shakespeare Folio.</p><br><br><p>J. P. Romney is a historical researcher and the author of the young adult novel <em>The Monster on the Road Is Me</em>.</p></p><h2>Persuasion (Teen Classics)</h2><p><p>Once so much to each other!</p><p>Now nothing!</p><p>Ann Elliot has only one regret: that she listened to her family and broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth. He was poor, but they were in love&#x2014;and she didn&#x2019;t realize that love was enough.</p><p>But Anne has a new chance: Captain Wentworth has returned from the Royal Navy. With everything stacked against her, can she overcome their heartbreak and persuade him to love her again?</p><p>Beautifully presented for a modern teen audience, Jane Austen&#x2019;s masterpiece is one of the most enduring stories about the resilience of love. </p></p><p>Anne Elliot, heroine of Austen&#39;s last novel, did something we can all relate to: Long ago, she let the love of her life get away. In this case, she had allowed herself to be persuaded by a trusted family friend that the young man she loved wasn&#39;t an adequate match, social stationwise, and that Anne could do better. The novel opens some seven years after Anne sent her beau packing, and she&#39;s still alone. But then the guy she never stopped loving comes back from the sea. As always, Austen&#39;s storytelling is so confident, you can&#39;t help but allow yourself to be taken on the enjoyable journey.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Time has not diminished the progressiveness of his business philosophy, or his profound influence on worldwide industry. The modern printing of <strong>Today and Tomorrow</strong> features an introduction by James J. Padilla, Group Vice President, Ford North America. It also includes an enhanced selection of photos illustrating the processes and facilities Ford covers in the text. Taiichi Ohno acknowledged that a key stimulus to JIT was his close reading of this book. Today, these same ideas are re-emerging to revitalize American industry in new ways. </p> <p></p> <p><em>"I, for one, am in awe of Ford's greatness. I believe Ford was a born rationalist -- and I feel more so every time I read his writings. He had a deliberate and scientific way of thinking about industry in America. For example, on the issues of standardization and the nature of waste in business, Ford's perception of things was orthodox and universal."<br></em>&#x2015; Taiichi Ohno </p></p><p></p><h2>The Small House at Allington (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Engaged to the ambitious and self-serving Adolphus Crosbie, Lily Dale is devastated when he jilts her for the aristocratic Lady Alexandrina. Although crushed by his faithlessness, Lily still believes she is bound to her unworthy former fiance for life and therefore condemned to remain single after his betrayal. And when a more deserving suitor pays his addresses, she is unable to see past her feelings for Crosbie. Written when Trollope was at the height of his popularity, The Small House at Allington (1864) contains his most admired heroine in Lily Dale a young woman of independent spirit who nonetheless longs to be loved and is a moving dramatization of the ways in which personal dilemmas are affected by social pressures.</p><p>Roderick Random was published in 1748 to immediate acclaim, and established Smollett among the most popular of eighteenth-century novelists. Narrated by an unheroic, apparently rudderless hero named Random, Smollett&#39;s wildly energetic and entertaining novel is held together not least by the narrator&#39;s outrage and dismay. Although Roderick Random was first published anonymously, the secret of Smollett&#39;s authorship was soon discovered, with the result that many readers thought they recognized similarities between the life of the hero and that of his creator. Certainly Roderick Random&#39;s early years - disinherited and without wealth and influence - and his university career, apprenticeship and service as a naval surgeon, vividly reflect the experiences of the author. How Random learns to survive the fickle hand of fortune, recovers his long-lost father, marries his beloved Narcissa, and dispatches his enemies is the stuff, not of autobiography but of a novel which profoundly satirizes the moral chaos of its times. Dickens and Thackeray, among other great Victorians, applauded Smollett for his wit and invention, and in Roderick Random we enjoy the novel of a pioneer opening up the frontiers of fiction.<b>Anthony Trollope </b>(1815-1882) was born in London to a bankrupt barrister father and a mother who, as a well-known writer, supported the family. Trollope enjoyed considerable acclaim both as a novelist and as a senior civil servant in the Post Office. He published more than forty novels and many short stories that are regarded by some as among the greatest of nineteenth-century fiction.</p><h2>Patterns of World History: Volume Two: From 1400 with Sources</h2><p><em>Patterns of World History</em>, Third Edition, offers a distinct framework for understanding the global past through the study of origins, interactions, and adaptations. Authors Peter von Sivers, Charles A. Desnoyers, and George B. Stow examine the full range of human ingenuity over time and space in a comprehensive, evenhanded, and critical fashion. <br><br>The authors offer a distinct intellectual framework for the role of innovation and historical change through patterns of <strong>origins, interactions, </strong>and<strong> adaptations</strong>. Each small or large technical or cultural innovation originated in one geographical center or independently in several different centers. As people in the centers interacted with their neighbors, the neighbors adapted to and in many cases were transformed by the innovations. By "adaptation" the authors include the entire spectrum of human responses, ranging from outright rejection to creative borrowing and, at times, forced acceptance. Seeing patterns of various kinds in historical development brings to light connections and linkages among peoples, cultures, and regions that might not otherwise present themselves.<br><br>Such patterns can also reveal differences among cultures that other approaches to world history tend to neglect. For example, the differences between the civilizations of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres are generally highlighted in world history texts, but the broad commonalities of human groups creating agriculturally based cities and states in widely separated areas also show deep parallels in their patterns of origins, interactions, and adaptations. Such comparisons are at the center of <em>Patterns of World History</em>. This kind of analysis offers insights into how an individual innovation was subsequently developed and diffused across time and space that is, the patterns by which the new eventually becomes a necessity in daily lives. Through all of this we gain a deeper appreciation of the unfolding of global history from its origins in small, isolated areas to the vast networks of global interconnectedness in our present world.<br><br>The authors' use of a broad based understanding of continuity, change, and innovation allows them to restore culture in all its individual and institutionalized aspects spiritual, artistic, intellectual, scientific to its rightful place alongside technology, environment, politics, and socioeconomic conditions. Understanding innovation in this way allows this text to help illuminate the full range of human ingenuity over time and space in a comprehensive, evenhanded, and open ended fashion.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter von Sivers</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of Utah.<br><br><strong>Charles A.

A story book tells a story with words. Although the pictures amplify it, the story can be understood without them. The pictures have an auxiliary role, because the words themselves contain images. In contrast, a true picture book tells a story mainly or entirely with pictures.<b>Uri Shulevitz</b> has written and illustrated more than 30 children's books.

Not only are they home to the richest diversity of creatures, but they work hard for humans too.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> An old-growth forest is one that has formed naturally over a long period of time with little or no disturbance from humankind. They are increasingly rare and largely misunderstood. In <i>Nature&#x2019;s Temples</i>, Joan Maloof, the director of the Old-Growth Forest Network, makes a heartfelt and passionate case for their importance. This evocative and accessible narrative defines old-growth and provides a brief history of forests. It offers a rare view into how the life-forms in an ancient, undisturbed forest&#x2014;including not only its majestic trees but also its insects, plant life, fungi, and mammals&#x2014;differ from the life-forms in a forest manipulated by humans. What emerges is a portrait of a beautiful, intricate, and fragile ecosystem that now exists only in scattered fragments. Black-and-white illustrations by Andrew Joslin help clarify scientific concepts and capture the beauty of ancient trees.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Joan Maloof is a scientist, writer, and the founder and director of the Old-Growth Forest network, a nonprofit organization creating a network of forests across the U.S. that will remain forever unlogged and open to the public. She studied plant science at the University of Delaware, environmental science at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, and ecology at the University of Maryland College Park. She is the author of&nbsp;<i>Teaching the Trees</i>&nbsp;and <i>Among the Ancients</i>.<b>Preface</b><br> Forests have sprung naturally from the earth with no help required from humans. Although trees are the most obvious part of a forest, many, many other life forms exist there as well. The measure of this variety of life forms is termed biodiversity. The past ten thousand years have seen a drastic reduction in biodiversity due to human activities, primarily the way we manipulate the land. Many species have disappeared completely. Harvesting wood products from forests is one way that humans affect the land. In this book we look specifically at how the life forms in an ancient undisturbed forest, including the trees, differ from the life forms in a forest manipulated by humans. The details are shared in these pages, but I will give you the conclusion up front: more species exist in old-growth forests than in the forests we manage for wood products, and some species exist only in older forests.<br><br> In the chapters ahead you will frequently see old-growth forests compared to managed forests, so perhaps it is useful to clarify these terms right away. The forests that have formed naturally over a long period of time with little or no disturbance we call old-growth forests. In contrast, managed forests are the result of purposeful human action. Management techniques include logging, thinning, burning, planting, and spraying. Forests can be managed in many different ways and for many different reasons, but most often they are managed to grow timber for particular wood products that result in a financial return.<br><br> Although wood is a wonderful renewable resource, and most owners of forestland are now careful to replant after harvesting, it is a misconception that typical forest management can conserve all forest biodiversity. Scientific evidence tells us otherwise. In these pages I present the evidence. The studies that enable us to challenge the misconception are sprinkled far and wide among many different journals and over many years, so I thought it helpful to compile descriptions of the studies and their results in a book. I originally intended to include only the studies done in eastern North American forests (since the western forests have been the focus of other books), and although the focus here remains on eastern forests, I soon realized that including a global perspective added depth to the evidence.<br> Over and over I have read or heard espoused that forests must be managed to be healthy. Perhaps forests must be managed to get the healthiest economic return, but true biological health is found in the unmanaged old-growth forests. I can say that because the scientists who have done these careful studies have offered their data to us. I also know it to be true because I have spent time in many, many old-growth forests and have heard the birdsong, witnessed the soaring canopies, and breathed the forest air.<br><br> &#x201c;When we try to pick out anything by itself,&#x201d; John Muir wrote in My First Summer in the Sierra, &#x201c;we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.&#x201d; The truth of this often-quoted line will be evidenced over and over again in these pages. Although each chapter has a specific topic, you will soon see that they are all, indeed, hitched together.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding the Political World (12th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE</b>: You are purchasing a&nbsp;<b>standalone</b>&nbsp;product; MyPoliSciLabï¿½&nbsp;does not come packaged with this content.

Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. American linguist Paul Postal wrote in 1964 that most of the &#34;syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States&#34; were &#34;versions of the theory of phrase structure grammars in the sense of Chomsky&#34;. British linguist John Lyons wrote in 1966 that &#34;no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky&#39;s Syntactic Structures.&#34; Prominent historian of linguistics R. H. Robins wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky&#39;s &#34;Syntactic Structures&#34; was &#34;probably the most radical and important change in direction in descriptive linguistics and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years&#34;. Another historian of linguistics Frederick Newmeyer considers &#34;Syntactic Structures&#34; &#34;revolutionary&#34; for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a formal yet non-empiricist theory of language was possible and more importantly, it demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of English grammar. Secondly, it put syntax at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. As a result, morphology and phonology were relegated in importance. &#34;Syntactic Structures&#34; also initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between philosophers of language and linguists. American philosopher John Searle wrote that &#34;Chomsky&#39;s work is one of the most remarkable intellectual achievements of the present era, comparable in scope and coherence to the work of Keynes or Freud. It has done more than simply produce a revolution in linguistics; it has created a new discipline of generative grammar and is having a revolutionary effect on two other subjects, philosophy and psychology&#34;. With its formal and logical treatment of language, Syntactic Structures also brought linguistics and the new field of computer science closer together.</p><p>Noam Chomsky is Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA.David W. Lightfoot is Professor at Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA."Chomsky's book on syntactic structures is one of the first serious attempts on the part of a linguist to construct within the tradition of scientific theory-construction a comprehensive theory of language which may be understood in the same sense that a chemical, biological theory is ordinarily understood by experts in those fields. It is not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalog, nor another speculative philosophy about the nature of Man and Language, but rather a rigorous explication of our intuitions about our language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages; and it may well provide an opportunity for the application of explicit measures of simplicity to decide preference of one form over another form of grammar."Robert B. Lees in: 'Language' "I had already decided I wanted to be a linguist when I discovered this book. But it is unlikely that I would have stayed in the field without it. It has been the single most inspiring book on linguistics in my whole career."

The simple, informative text presents the complex cast of characters residing in or on the living tree as well as the decomposing log?from woodpeckers, squirrels, and porcupines to carpenter ants, millipedes, slugs, and fungi. The verbal descriptions of this rich ecosystem are enhanced by striking illustrations of three-dimensional paper sculptures, often so realistic as to seem to be preserved natural specimens.

Richardson lays out the tragic history of anti-Semitism within the church from the very beginning in what may be the most thorough repudiation of what has become known as &#x201c;Replacement Theology,&#x201d; or, as Richardson calls it, &#x201c;Supersessionism.&#x201d;</p> <p>Joseph Farah, founder of WND.com, calls <em>When a Jew Rules the World</em> &#x201c;one of the most important books of our time &#x2013; a chance for Christians to rediscover their true identity as fellow heirs of promise with the House of Israel, the wild olive branches grafted into the tree of the Abrahamic Covenant. Paul explained how we are grafted into that tree. The tree is not dead. It hasn&#x2019;t been uprooted. It&#x2019;s still very much alive, as Richardson so masterfully demonstrates through scripture.&#x201d;</p> <p>Chuck Missler praises <em>When a Jew Rules the World,</em> calling the book, &#x201c;A must read for the serious Christian.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>What exactly is the Abrahamic Covenant, and is it still relevant today? &nbsp;</li> <li>Has the New Testament done away with the Old Testament? &nbsp;</li> <li>Is the Church the new and true Israel?&nbsp;</li> <li>What is the Kingdom of God?</li> <li>What lies ahead for the State of Israel?</li> <li>How should gentile believers relate to unbelieving Jews?&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Richardson answers these questions and more as he carefully walks the reader through the most essential passages of the Bible that must be understood if one desires to combat the growing Christian anti-Semitism. As the rage and resistance of Satan to God&#x2019;s plans with Israel continues to spread throughout the earth, now is the hour for discerning Christians everywhere to arm themselves with a clear understanding of these profoundly importand and foundational matters.</p> (Joel Richardson)</p><p><p><b>Joel Richardson</b>&nbsp;is the author of several books including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling&nbsp;<i>Islamic Antichrist: The Shocking Truth About the Real Nature of the Beast</i>.

Instead, he surprised readers and himself by taking an enormous step in the direction of literary fiction, creating a book that continues to dazzle with the variety of its many idioms and the sheer exuberance of its depiction of frontier life," Henry Wonham tells us in his afterword. Marking a crucial phase in the author's life and career, <em>Roughing It</em> vividly recounts Twain's adventures in the West. Twain blends autobiography and tall tale to produce this engaging humorous account of six boisterous years in Nevada, San Francisco, and Hawaii. Genteel culture meets frontier culture head-on in this wildly inventive, high-spirited book, and neither will ever be the same.</p><p>Shelley Fisher Fishkin, Professor of American Studies, University of Texas, Austin.</p><h2>The Little Book of Fika: The Uplifting Daily Ritual of the Swedish Coffee Break</h2><p>A little book on the Swedish tradition of <i>fika&#x2014;</i>the twice-daily coffee break&#x2014;including facts, quotes, tips, and 20 sweet and savory recipes.&nbsp;<br><br>While the Danish concept of <i>hygge</i> as caught on around the globe, so has <i>lagom&#x2014;</i>its Swedish counterpart.

The outwardly simple narrative of an office clerk who kills an Arab, 'a cause du soleil', and finds himself condemned to death for moral insensibility becomes, in Camus's hands, a powerful image of modern man's impatience before Christian philosophy and conventional social and sexual values. For this new edition Ray Davison makes use of recent critical analysis of <em>L'Etranger </em>to give a full and concise description of Camus's early philosophy of the Absurd and the ideas and preoccupations from which the novel emerges. Davison also discusses the developing pattern of Camus's notion of the art of the novel, his views on 'classicism', simplicity and ambiguity, his fondness for paradox, and his love of everyday situations which yield to mythical interpretation. </p></p><p>Albert Camuswas born in Algeria in 1913.

Gershwin created some of the most beloved music of the twentieth century and, along with Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and Cole Porter, helped make the golden age of Broadway golden. Howard Pollack draws from a wealth of sketches, manuscripts, letters, interviews, books, articles, recordings, films, and other materials&#x2015;including a large cache of Gershwin scores discovered in a Warner Brothers warehouse in 1982&#x2015;to create an expansive chronicle of Gershwin&#x2019;s meteoric rise to fame. He also traces Gershwin&#x2019;s powerful presence that, even today, extends from Broadway, jazz clubs, and film scores to symphony halls and opera houses.<br><br>Pollack&#x2019;s lively narrative describes Gershwin&#x2019;s family, childhood, and education; his early career as a pianist; his friendships and romantic life; his relation to various musical trends; his writings on music; his working methods; and his tragic death at the age of 38. Unlike Kern, Berlin, and Porter, who mostly worked within the confines of Broadway and Hollywood, Gershwin actively sought to cross the boundaries between high and low, and wrote works that crossed over into a realm where art music, jazz, and Broadway met and merged. The author surveys Gershwin&#x2019;s entire oeuvre, from his first surviving compositions to the melodies that his brother and principal collaborator, Ira Gershwin, lyricized after his death. Pollack concludes with an exploration of the performances and critical reception of Gershwin's music over the years, from his time to ours.</p><p>"Filled with new and revelatory information, Howard Pollack's fascinating and meticulous book is the closest anyone has come to capturing the essence of Gershwin's life and work"&#x2015;Michael Feinstein, Grammy Nominated Singer-Songwriter<br><br>"The scholarship and breadth of coverage are remarkable.

From the time we have our first childhood lesson of keeping our hands off the hot stove to our mature ability to recognize danger and get out of the way, fear has earned our respect and has tremendous influence over our behavior. But sometimes fear holds us back because it is at the root of many of our most deepseated issues, those that keep us from locating the main blockages to our personal energy and power. <br><br><b>Fear Journey with Sekhmet</b> <br><br><i>[Allow yourself to be very comfortable as you close your eyes and ground and center yourself. Take a moment to find your heart flame and feed it with love. As you pour love upon your heart flame, inhale the powers of Earth and Sky. Reach with your breath into the heart of the Earth and draw the vitality, the power, the strength and healing energies, and the vital life force of Earth all the way up to your heart center where it enters your heart fire and mingles with the intelligence, power, and love that you have drawn down from the sky.]</i> <br><br>As you exhale, express the breath through your entire body and let a new level of alertness and clarity enter every cell of your being. As you exhale and the radiance of your heart flame grows, look outside the circle of light that surrounds you like a halo. Look into that place of darkness that inevitably surrounds us all. As you put your attention beyond the comforting glow of light, you will see the eyes of Sekhmet gleaming in the darkness. On your next exhale, send your heart breath to Sekhmet as you ask her to join you and help you deal with the fears that inhabit your being. As you connect with Sekhmet, she stands before you in her goddess form, a woman&#x2019;s body with a lioness head surmounted with a uraeus crown holding the sun disc. <br><br>If this is the first time you are meeting Sekhmet, allow yourself to connect with her eye to eye and heart to heart. She may place a hand or paw upon your chest. Allow yourself to feel her sekhem, her power, moving into your heart and through your circulatory system into every cell and molecule of your body, reminding every part of you that this goddess truly lives within you, and you feel as though you are filled with her courage and power. . . . [<i>Pause</i>.] <br><br>For now, Sekhmet has come to help you work through your fears. As you continue to feel her power coursing through your being, she morphs into her beautiful lioness form, nudging you to become a lioness with her. . . . She is going to take you on a journey into the savanna. Feel yourself begin to transfigure into a lioness. You can feel your breath, your body, and your muscles change. Feel your whiskers grow and begin to sense how they communicate information to you. . . .Stretch into the fullness of your lioness being and follow Sekhmet, feeling the grace and strength with which the two of you are running across the savanna. . . . <br><br>Off in the distance you begin to perceive the first fear that is coming up to meet you. Sekhmet shows you how to stop and crouch in the grass to watch. . . . Observe this fear closely. Listen very carefully. Sniff the air. You can smell it. You may even be able to taste in on your tongue. Is this a fear that is serving your higher self? Is it keeping you safe? Notice where you feel it in your body and how your body reacts to it. . . . [<i>Pause</i>.] <br><br>If this fear is something that still serves you then honor it. If it has served you in the past to keep you safe, honor it and thank it. If it is a fear that you wish to transform, Sekhmet may nudge you to stand and look directly at this fear. . . . You hear a low grumbling, rumbling sound that is coming from you. Let the sound build as you face this fear. Let loose with a large roar! Notice how the fear reacts. Do not be shy. Sekhmet is right there with you! The roar seems to have a life of its own. As it diminishes, mark this fear with a knot in your twine. . . . [<i>Pause</i>.] <br><br>Continue hunting more of these fears, following the same process. As you seek out each fear, remember to honor and give gratitude, then roar and let go of that which no longer serves you. Sometimes you will know the source of the fear and sometimes that is obscured. Regardless, tie it in a knot in your twine and continue on your hunt with Sekhmet. . . . [<i>Long</i> <i>pause</i>.] <br><br>When there are no more fears showing up, you and Sekhmet walk side by side enjoying the sun in the aftermath of the hunt. She has shown you how to hunt and how to face your fears. <br><br>As you slowly walk back to your place in present time and space, Sekhmet slowly returns to her goddess form. Take one last stretch in your lioness form, relishing the power and strength that is the natural state of a healthy lioness. . . . Now feel yourself come back into your human form. . . . Walk with Sekhmet now and ask if she has any further instructions for you. . . . [<i>Pause</i>.] <br><br>Be sure to express your gratitude to Sekhmet. Thank yourself for having the courage to face your fears and offer prayers for others that you know and the world in general to be able to live free of fear. When you feel complete, take a deep Earth breath pulling up the Earth energy to ground you into your body. Slowly open your eyes.</p><h2>Beyond the Limits: Confronting Global Collapse, Envisioning a Sustainable Future</h2><p>Discusses how to prevent the global economic collapse that is possible if current trends don&#39;t change</p><p>An impressive sequel to the controversial and influential Limits to Growth (1972) prepared by three of the authors of that environmental clarion call and based on worldwide data compiled during the past 20 years. Donella H. Meadows (Environmental Studies/Dartmouth), Dennis L. Meadows (Management Studies/Univ. of New Hampshire), and Randers (Policy Analysis/Norwegian School of Management) use a vast array of statistics, projections, and charts to assert that global limits have already been exceeded in certain growth areas. Current crop yields can only sustain the world's population at subsistence levels, they point out, while nonrenewable energy resources and fresh water supplies are dwindling, and greenhouse gases and other pollutants increase. But while the prognosis is disaster within decades if nothing is done, there are encouraging signs. Technology offers greater efficiency in energy consumption and pollution control, international response to the ozone crisis has been relatively swift, and recycling efforts are gaining headway. The authors warn, however, that the conditions underlying limit ``overshoots''--population growth and resource depletion in a finite world, for example--remain unaddressed in the corridors of power. Modifying the computer-modeling system employed in their first work, the authors graphically depict plausible futures ranging from utter collapse to manageable growth, each depending on the controls used, and they urgently propose a series of general measures that would commence the long-overdue transition to a sustainable global society. An invaluable update that leaves no doubt that the time to effect meaningful change has grown extremely short, but that nevertheless shuns gloom and doom to be boldly pragmatic about the future. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In 1972 The Limits of Growth , sponsored by the Club of Rome and produced by a research team on a MIT computer programmed with a World3 model, created a stormy sensation. Denounced as eco-gloom and doom, the book also became a keystone of the era's environmentalism. Now on the eve of the June U.N. Earth Summit, three of the researchers give World3 another run. Although many books and reports examine "sustainability," the authors provide unique insights thanks to their background in systems analysis. Society has gone into overshoot, they argue, a state of being beyond limits without knowing it. These limits are more like speed limits than barriers at the end of the road: the rate at which renewable resources can renew themselves, the rate at which we can change from nonrenewable resources to renewable ones, and the rate at which nature can recycle our pollution. Without being a catch-all on the environmental crisis, the book shows how we are overshooting such crucial resources as food and water while overwhelming nature with pollutants like those causing global warming. World3 runs 13 future scenarios and learns that we can only avoid collapse by unplugging the exponential growth in population (two billions people in the past 20 years) and industrial production (doubled in the past 20 years). If the world settles for two children per couple and the per capita income of South Korea, we can avoid collapse and find an equilibrium at 7.7 billion people through 2100. Systems analysis may sound like an academic specialty, but the authors have written for the general reader and provide a compelling challenge to traditional economics and public complacency. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>ETHICS (with CourseMate Printed Access Card) (Explore Our New Philosophy 1st Editions)</h2><p>Designed for today&#39;s students through continuous feedback from students like you, ETHICS delivers a visually appealing, succinct print component, tear-out review cards and CourseMate, our online digital product that is proven to enhance your learning experience and improve your grades.

Walton Litz</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.&#x201d; So begins Jane Austen&#x2019;s comic masterpiece <i>Emma</i>. In <i>Emma, </i>Austen&#x2019;s prose brilliantly elevates, in the words of Virginia Woolf, &#x201c;the trivialities of day-to-day existence, of parties, picnics, and country dances&#x201d; of early-nineteenth-century life in the English countryside to an unrivaled level of pleasure for the reader. At the center of this world is the inimitable Emma Woodhouse, a self-proclaimed matchmaker who, by the novel&#x2019;s conclusion, may just find herself the victim of her own best intentions.<br> &nbsp;<br> INCLUDES A MODERN LIBRARY READING GROUP GUIDE</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus.

Until now, however, no author has systematically studied end-of-life communication by using examples from ordinary people. When her father became terminally ill with cancer, author Lisa Smartt began transcribing his conversations and noticed that his personality underwent inexplicable changes. Smartt&#x2019;s father, once a skeptical man with a secular worldview, developed a deeply spiritual outlook in his final days &#x2015; a change reflected in his language. Baffled and intrigued, Smartt began to investigate what other people have said while nearing death, collecting more than one hundred case studies through interviews and transcripts. In this groundbreaking and insightful book, Smartt shows how the language of the dying can point the way to a transcendent world beyond our own.</p><p><b>Lisa Smartt, MA,</b> is a linguist, educator, and poet. She founded the Final Words Project, an ongoing study devoted to collecting and interpreting the mysterious language at the end of lives. She lives in Athens, Georgia.&#x201c;<i>Words at the Threshold</i> is a treasure trove of experience and insight around the last words spoken by the dying, as revealed through the mind of a linguist, proposing that birth and death are different facets of the same process, that both are essential in the cycle of life, and that our soul connections do not end with death. The words of the dying provide some of the most salient clues as to how we can best live our lives on earth.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; <b>Eben Alexander, MD, </b>neurosurgeon and author of <i>Proof of Heaven</i> and <i>The Map of Heaven</i><br><br>&#x201c;With <i>Words at the Threshold</i>, Lisa Smartt has given the world of near death studies a fresh new path for research.

Lisa Smartt&#x2019;s work has profound psychological, spiritual, and clinical implications for the care of terminally ill patients and their families. And I believe that her work also opens unexplored pathways for the genuinely rational investigation of human kind&#x2019;s deepest mystery: the prospect of life after death.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; from the foreword by<b> Raymond Moody Jr., MD, PhD, </b>author of <i>Life After Life</i><br><br>&#x201c;Lisa Smartt gently invites us to listen to the utterances of the dying with an inner ear attuned to another kind of reality. She charts how the dying use eerily familiar metaphors, symbols, time loops, and more to express their expanded, nonlinear experiences. In so doing, Smartt affords us a precious glimpse of their inner worlds as they linger at the threshold of death. Through her linguistic analysis of &#x2018;nonsense&#x2019; on the lips of the dying, the underlying creativity and purpose of final words are revealed. <i>Words at the Threshold</i> is a significant step toward transforming the current views of dying from a process of failure into a process of ever-deepening meaning and wonder.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; <b>Julia Assante, PhD, </b>author of<i> The Last Frontier</i><br><br>&#x201c;At the end of life, the curtain between worlds tears. <i>Words at the Threshold</i> documents what the dying say and see and hear in that moment of truth.

In this student-friendly text, Martin presents the fundamental principles of these important disciplines in as simple a manner as possible, favoring basic theory over special constructions. Among the areas covered are the equivalent four-bar linkage; rotating vector treatment for analyzing multi-cylinder engines; and critical speeds, including torsional vibration of shafts. The book also describes methods used to manufacture disk cams, and it discusses mathematical methods for calculating the cam profile, the pressure angle, and the locations of the cam. This book is an excellent choice for courses in kinematics of machines, dynamics of machines, and machine design and vibrations.</p><p>Title of related interest from Waveland Press: Hall, Notes on Mechanism Analysis (ISBN 9780881332704).</p><h2>The Leipzig Connection (Basics in Education)</h2><p>In the shadows of the Bismarck&#x2019;s totalitarian Germany in 1875, a little-known medical researcher laid the groundwork for a subject that in modern times was to bring American education to its knees--behavioral psychology. A latter-day disciple, B. F. Skinner, later wrote the book "Beyond Freedom and Dignity," arguing that such ancient conceptions as these are luxuries our brave new world can no longer afford. Another ardent follower--John Dewey, the "Father of American education"--took the new radical German redefinition of education to mean the reprograming of young brains and nervous systems, and applied it to his self-appointed task of creating in America the ideal socialist state. John D. Rockefeller, for purposes of his own, bankrolled what was in effect a hostile take-over of our educational establishment. "The Leipzig Connection" is a startling account of how and why these things came about. It lays out in concise detail the story of the development of the educational malaise which we have unknowingly dropped our children into, explaining not only declining SAT scores and the phenomenon of high school graduates who are barely literate, but also symptoms even more sinister: violence, prostitution and drug dealing in the schools, the self-mutilation of tattooing and body piercing, and teenage suicide.</p><p>Paolo Lionni was born in Switzerland in 1938 and was educated there, in Italy, and in the U.S. (Brandeis University). During his lifetime he served as art director of several national magazines and his drawings, poetry, essays, and translations have been published in Europe, the U.S., and Mexico. For the last 15 years of his life, he was very active in the field of education promoting an alternative to the educational philosophies described in &#34;The Leipzig Connection.&#34;In the final years of the last century, a great transformation began in American education. By the end of the first world war, Americans would notice increasingly a change in the way their children were being educated. In the succeeding decades, the same schools that once nurtured the American dream would become infested with drugs and crime, and high schools would be graduating students who could barely read, spell, or do simple arithmetic. <p>This report details the origins of a national metamorphosis, yet it is hardly definitive. Major changes in American education, along the same lines as those described herein (and, in many cases, overlapping them), were wrought by the great Carnegie and Ford "philanthropies" and by a host of individuals (i.e., Col. Parker, Goddard, Terman, Yerkes, Binet, Piaget, Watson, Skinner, Freire, Illich, et. al.). Agencies other than those mentioned in the book also played major roles. Foremost among these undoubtedly is the august and hyperactive NEA with its National Training Labs, publisher of the "Journal of Applied Behavioral Science." Special mention should also be made of UNESCO's International Bureau of Education (formerly the Institut Jean-Jacques Rousseau), born in 1925 of a generous grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. </p><p>These initial and somewhat unexpected findings, however, incomplete, are released in order to help others analyze more clearly this tragic transformation of the national character. Further research has simply substantiated and enlarged upon the thesis of this work. </p><p>The ongoing debasement of philosophy and ethics, and its social consequences, is a tangled tale and, where references are not pursued or fully detailed, it is not because of an unwillingness to answer the questions raised rather it is from a desire to suggest a broader context within which the story unfolds. Those who contend, with Wilhelm Wundt, that history and its processes are responsible for the formation of individuals and their views (rather than the reverse) will undoubtedly find this approach unpalatable; then again, not everyone would want this tale untangled.</p></p><h2>The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (Library of Latin America)</h2><p>"Be aware that frankness is the prime virtue of a dead man," writes the extraordinary narrator of <em>The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas</em>. "The gaze of public opinion, that sharp and judgmental gaze, loses its virtue the moment we tread the territory of death. I'm not saying that it doesn't reach here and examine and judge us, but we don't care about the examination or the judgment. My dear living gentlemen and ladies, there's nothing as incommensurable as the disdain of the deceased." Indeed, writing his memoirs from the other world gives Bras Cubas a certain freedom from both social and literary conventions. And while he may be dead, he is surely one of the liveliest characters in fiction, a product of one of the most remarkable imaginations in all of literature, Brazil's greatest novelist of the nineteenth century, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis.<br> Famous in his lifetime and still revered throughout Latin America, Machado de Assis has remained little known in the English-speaking world. He represents an important antecedent for the experimental fictions of Borges, Cortazar, Fuentes, and others. In this wildly inventive book, de Assis is, in fact, much closer to such postmodern masters as Calvino, Kundera, and Marquez than to the conventions of the nineteenth century realist and romantic novel, which the narrator continually and hilariously mocks. Irrepressibly whimsical, irreverent, chatty, and charmingly self-absorbed, Bras Cubas is forever intruding into his narrative, questioning, lecturing, and elbowing the reader, commenting on his writing and its highly unusual style--"this book and my style are like drunkards, they stagger left and right, they walk and stop, mumble, yell, cackle, shake their fists at the sky, stumble, and fall"--congratulating himself on particular chapters, wondering whether to cut others out, and interrupting his life story with all manner of digressions, from a philosophical discourse on the purpose of the nose to a visionary ride on the back of a rhinoceros to find the origin of the centuries. Along the way we're treated to a marvelous cast of characters, including the outlandish philosopher Quincas Borcas, who asserts that "asceticism is the perfection of human idiocy," and Virgilia, the beautiful married woman with whom Bras Cubas carries on a passionate and not-so-secret love affair. By turns flippant and profound, <em>The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas</em> is the story of an unheroic man with half-hearted political ambitions, a harebrained idea for curing the world of melancholy, and a thousand quixotic theories unleashed from beyond the grave. It is a novel that has influenced generations of Latin American writers but remains refreshingly and unforgettably unlike anything written before or after it.<br> Newly translated by Gregory Rabassa and superbly edited by Enylton de Sï¿½ Rego and Gilberto Pinheiro Passos, who provide an insightful introduction and afterword, this edition inaugurates Oxford's Library of Latin America series, and brings to English-speaking readers a literary delight of the highest order.<br></p><p>Fans of Latin American literature will be thrilled by Oxford University Press's new translations of works by 19th-century Brazilian author Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. His novels are both heartbreaking and comic; his limning of a colonial Brazil in flux is both perceptive and remarkably modern. <i>The Posthumous Memoirs of Brï¿½s Cubas</i> is written as an autobiography, a chronicle of the erotic misadventures of its narrator, Brï¿½s Cubas--who happens to be dead. In pursuit of love and progeny, Cubas rejects the women who want him and aspires to the ones who reject him. In the end, he dies unloved and without heirs, yet he somehow manages to turn this bitter pill into a victory of sorts. What makes <i>Memoirs</i> stand up 100 years after the book was written is Machado's biting humor, brilliant prose, and profound understanding of all the vagaries of human behavior.<br>Gregory Rabassa is the highly acclaimed translator of <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> and many other works of Latin American fiction. Enylton de Sï¿½ Rego is a Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Texas at Austin.

From the novice to the more well-versed, <i>Gwynne&#x2019;s Latin</i> is essential for anyone interested in learning Latin; Mr. Gwynne promises to teach you more Latin in half an hour than you would learn from years of being taught Latin at school. He also includes a fascinating section on everyday Latin usage, which discusses all the Latin words and idioms we still use today, such as <i>quid pro quo</i> and <i>sui generis</i>. Though we need no further convincing&#x2014;as we know, Mr Gwynne is never wrong&#x2014;here are just some of the many reasons why Latin is utterly wonderful: Latin is an academic subject easy enough for the least intelligent of us to grasp all the basic elements of, and yet difficult enough to be demanding for its greatest scholars. For well over 1,000 years it was the means of communication that united the whole of Europe culturally and in every other significant way. It is the direct ancestor of, between them, the five most widely-spoken European languages, and both of the official South American languages. It is the ancestor and source of more than half of the English language, partly directly and partly through French, which for some centuries was England&#x2019;s official language. Following in the same beautifully designed footsteps of <i>Gwynne&#x2019;s Grammar</i>, <i>Gwynne&#x2019;s Latin</i> will teach you all the fundamentals of Latin quickly, thoroughly, and better than all the competition.</p><p><b>N. M. Gwynne</b> began teaching in the 1980s, at first privately. He soon found that he had a clear vocation for teaching, and that his traditional methods, universal up to the 1960s and refined and perfected century after century up till then, had suddenly become all but unique because of the revolution in teaching that had taken place worldwide..

One day Bartleby declines the assignment his employer gives him with the inscrutable &#34;I would prefer not.&#34; The utterance of this remark sets off a confounding set of actions and behavior, making the unsettling character of Bartleby one of Melville&#39;s most enigmatic and unforgettable creations.</p><p>Herman Melville is a well-known American novelist, essayist and poet. His poetry is not as highly critically esteemed as his fiction, although some critics place him as the first modernist poet in the United States.''Herman Melville is one of American literature's greatest figures.'' --<i>The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English</i></p><h2>What&#39;s Bred in the Bone (Cornish Trilogy)</h2><p>Francis Cornish was always good at keeping secrets. From the well-hidden family secret of his childhood to his mysterious encounters with a small-town embalmer, an expert art restorer, a Bavarian countess, and various masters of espionage, the events in Francis&#x2019;s life were not always what they seemed. <br><br>In this wonderfully ingenious portrait of an art expert and collector of international renown, Robertson Davies has created a spellbinding tale of artistic triumph and heroic deceit. In this second book of the Cornish Trilogy, Davies spins a tale told in stylish, elegant prose, endowed with lavish portions of his wit and wisdom.&nbsp;<br><br>"A deliciously readable story...An altogether remarkable creation, his most accomplished novel to date." --&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;</i></p><p>Robertson Davies (1913-1995) had three successive careers during the time he became an internationally acclaimed author: actor, publisher, and, finally, professor at the University of Toronto. The author of twelve novels and several volumes of essays and plays, he was the first Canadian to be inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.Frederick Davidson performs this intelligent and entertaining novel about the life of Francis Cornish as told by the guardian spirit who controls his fate. Cornish is a secretive man of extraordinary artistic talent, who suffers with a lonely heart. The attentive listener is aided by Davidson&#39;s portrayal of this spirit&#39;s slightly detached, but affectionate and bemused, tone towards Cornish, as well as by Davidson&#39;s reasonable pace and careful pronunciation. Seasoned with a pleasant British dialect, Davidson&#39;s cultivated tone fits well Davies&#39;s elegant writing style. In addition, Davidson employs a rhythmic rising and falling of pitch, which is surprisingly effective in entertaining and relaxing the listener. His emphases are intelligently chosen, and his characterizations of women are especially good. P.W.

Along the way, Stevenson troubles our commonsense understanding of what life is and what it means to care for the life of another. Through close attention to the images in which we think and dream and through which we understand the world, Stevenson describes a world in which life is beside itself: the name-soul of a teenager who dies in a crash lives again in his friend&#x2019;s newborn baby, a young girl shares a last smoke with a dead friend in a dream, and the possessed hands of a clock spin uncontrollably over its face. In these contexts, humanitarian policies make little sense because they attempt to save lives by merely keeping a body alive. For the Inuit, and perhaps for all of us, life is &#x201c;somewhere else,&#x201d; and the task is to articulate forms of care for others that are adequate to that truth.</p><p>"<i>Life Beside Itself</i> is a profound reflection on the psychic life of biopolitics and how the biopolitical state, committed to enhancing the life of the population, renders lifeless a people&#x2019;s particular form of life. Lisa Stevenson writes with attentiveness to the care that binds the living and the dead in Inuit communities. That is itself a form of ethical living. Her writing is surely touched by grace. Her book illuminates the problem of suicide as the light of the moon illuminates a darkened sky. She helps us not to turn away from this suffering but to hold it.

Her life by water, as she called it, could not have been further removed from the avant-garde poetry scene where she also made a home. Niedecker is one of the most important poets of her generation and an essential member of the Objectivist circle. Her work attracted high praise from her peers--Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky, Cid Corman, Clayton Eshleman--with whom she exchanged life-sustaining letters. Niedecker was also a major woman poet who interrogated issues of gender, domesticity, work, marriage, and sexual politics long before the modern feminist movement. Her marginal status, both geographically and as a woman, translates into a major poetry.<br><br>Niedecker's lyric voice is one of the most subtle and sensuous of the twentieth century. Her ear is constantly alive to sounds of nature, oddities of vernacular speech, textures of vowels and consonants. Often compared to Emily Dickinson, Niedecker writes a poetry of wit and emotion, cosmopolitan experimentation and down-home American speech.<br><br>This much-anticipated volume presents all of Niedecker's surviving poetry, plays, and creative prose in the sequence of their composition. It includes many poems previously unpublished in book form plus all of Niedecker's surviving 1930s surrealist work and her 1936-46 folk poetry, bringing to light the formative experimental phases of her early career. With an introduction that offers an account of the poet's life and notes that provide detailed textual information, this book will be the definitive reader's and scholar's edition of Niedecker's work.</p><p>"Lorine Niedecker proves a major poet of the 20th century, just as Emily Dickinson was for the 19th. Bleak indeed that both should have been so curiously overwritten and ignored, when their work defined the time in which they lived with such genius. Jenny Penberthy has provided an excellent text and a comprehensive, detailing introduction. Finally, we have the collected poems of that poet whom her peers thought the very best of their company. Now one can know why."&#x2015;Robert Creeley, <i>The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1945-1975</i><br><br>"Lorine Niedecker was neither a Sappho nor an Emily Dickinson. She was a mid-western-born, self-created modernist who worked as a librarian, a floor-scrubber, a WPA writer, a housewife; and whose acrid, vitally alive poems earned her the admiration and friendship of her poetic peers."&#x2015;Adrienne Rich, author of <i>Diving into the Wreck</i><br><br>"Like the other poets associated with the Objectivist movement, Lorine Niedecker's work is quiet, original, and exact. She's as much of her place, that watery world of the Wisconsin lake country, as any American writer and as quirky as the best of them."&#x2015;Robert Hass, former Poet Laureate of the United States<br><br>"If she lacks the epigrammatist's cutting assurance, Niedecker's semblance of unpreparedness may make for a greater precision of statement: Kenneth Cox says it all when he describes her setting one thing alongside another with 'the tremulous certainty of a compass needle.'"&#x2015;Thom Gunn, author of <i>Boss Cupid</i><b>Lorine Niedecker </b>was born in 1903 and died in 1970.

Describing the power relations that sustain and make possible photographic meanings, Azoulay argues that anyone&#x2015;even a stateless person&#x2015;who addresses others through photographs or is addressed by photographs can become a member of the citizenry of photography. The civil contract of photography enables anyone to pursue political agency and resistance through photography.</p><p>Photography, Azoulay insists, cannot be understood separately from the many catastrophes of recent history. The crucial arguments of her book concern two groups with flawed or nonexistent citizenship: the Palestinian noncitizens of Israel and women in Western societies. Azoulay analyzes Israeli press photographs of violent episodes in the Occupied Territories, and interprets various photographs of women&#x2015;from famous images by stop-motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge to photographs from Abu Ghraib prison. Azoulay asks this question: under what legal, political, or cultural conditions does it become possible to see and to show disaster that befalls those who can claim only incomplete or nonexistent citizenship?</p><p>Drawing on such key texts in the history of modern citizenship as the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man</i> together with relevant work by Giorgio Agamben, Jean-Franï¿½ois Lyotard, Susan Sontag, and Roland Barthes, Azoulay explores the visual field of catastrophe, injustice, and suffering in our time. Her book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the disasters of recent history&#x2015;and the consequences of how these events and their victims have been represented.</p></p><p>Ariella is Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature and Modern Culture and Media at Brown University and the author of <i>Death's Showcase: the Power of Image in Contemporary Democracy</i> (MIT Press).<p>...nothing less than a wholesale restatement of the contemporary political stakes of the image...</p>&#x2015;<i>Art Review</i><br><br><p><i>The Civil Contract of Photography</i> does not simply delineate how meaning is contained in or created through photograph; it demonstrates precisely how meaning avoids being cheated. If there is one lesson to take from Azoulay's writing, it is that photography is a profoundly political act&#x2015;an act that is also, in the strictest sense, public.</p>&#x2015;<i>Aperture</i><br><br><p><i>The Civil Contract of Photography</i> will likely be one of the most influential books to shape the contemporary inquiry of photography and public culture.</p>&#x2015;<i>Argumentation and Advocacy</i><br><br><p>... Azoulay's central themes&#x2015;state violence, violations of human rights, and the nature and potential of photographic witness&#x2015;are as relevant to our own political circumstances as they are to hers.</p>&#x2015;<i>Art in America</i><br><br><p>... this is a significant, deeply moral book that should undercut complacent thinking. Azoulay's renewal of cultural attention to the state and her view of photography that requires us to dispute prevailing interpretations of evidence must surely be welcomed as we are, once again, thrown headlong back to reality.</p>&#x2015;<b>Steve Edwards</b>, <i>Times Higher Education</i></p><h2>Helena</h2><p><b>Evelyn Waugh's personal favorite of his novels and "a superlatively well done book" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) set in the age of Emperor Constantine. </b><br><br>Helena is the intelligent, horse-mad daughter of a British chieftain who is thrown into marriage with the man who will one day become the Roman emperor Constantius. Leaving home for lands unknown, she spends her adulthood seeking truth in the religions, mythologies, and philosophies of the declining ancient world, and becomes initiated into Christianity just as it is recognized as the religion of the Roman Empire. <i>Helena</i>--a novel that Evelyn Waugh considered to be his favorite, and most ambitious, work--deftly traverses the forces of corruption, treachery, enlightenment, and political intrigue of Imperial Rome as it brings to life an inspiring heroine.</p><p>Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966), whom <i>Time</i> called "one of the century's great masters of English prose," wrote several widely acclaimed novels as well as volumes of biography, memoir, travel writing, and journalism.

It focuses on the contracts of wage labor and marriage, investigating the connections between abolition in the South and industrial capitalism in the North and linking labor relations to home life. Integrating the fields of gender and legal, intellectual and social history, it reveals how abolitionists, former slaves, feminists, laborers, lawmakers and others drew on contract to condemn chattel slavery and to measure the virtues of free society.</p><p>Stanley is affiliated with the University of Chicago."Amy Dru Stanley's From Bondage to Contract is a transformative reinterpretation of American public life in late nineteenth century America, a triumph of the historical imagination and a profound reflection on contractualism as a moral and political discourse. Stanley's subject is contractualism at its moment of triumph, after slave emancipation. And her narrative explores points of tension and conflict in the moral universe in which 'freedom of contract' apparently reigned supreme: labor relations, marriage reform, begging and vagrancy, and prostitution. Her contractualism is never a conceptual monolith; From Bondage to Contract delineates many differing and competing contractualist reponses to the radically changed moral and economic universe that late nineteenth century Americans confronted." Hendrik Hartog, Class of 1921 Bicentennial Professor of the History of American Law and Liberty at Princeton University<br><br>"Brilliantly researched and skillfully argued, this is a work that transcends genres and subdisciplines, one that historians of gender, of labor, of poverty, legal historians, historians of political thought, public choice theorists, not to mention everybody who identifies as a liberal or a libertarian, will have to confront." Hendrik Hartog, Class of 1921 Bicentennial Professor of the History of American Law and Liberty at Princeton University<br><br>"Stanley analyzes how Americans `reconsidered the meaning of freedom after slavery's downfall,' emphasizing the `ambiguities of wage labor and marriage in a society that counted itself free because it had replaced bondage with contract.'

The central theme is that the risks faced by financial institutions managers and the methods and markets through which these risks are managed are becoming increasingly similar whether an institution is chartered as a commercial bank, a savings bank, an investment bank, or an insurance company. Although the traditional nature of each sector's product activity is analyzed, a greater emphasis is placed on new areas of activities such as asset securitization, off-balance-sheet banking, and international banking.</p></p><p>Anthony Saunders received his Ph.D. from the London School of Economics.

His yearly gatherings of short and inventive problems were easily his most anticipated math columns. Loyal readers would savor the wit and elegance of his explorations in physics, probability, topology, and chess, among others. Grouped by subject and arrayed from easiest to hardest, the puzzles gathered here, which complement the lengthier, more involved problems in <em>The Colossal Book of Mathematics</em>, have been selected by Gardner for their illuminating; and often bewildering; solutions. Filled with over 300 illustrations, this new volume even contains nine new mathematical gems that Gardner, now ninety, has been gathering for the last decade. No amateur or expert math lover should be without this indispensable volume; a capstone to Gardner's seventy-year career. 308 illustrations</p><p>Martin Gardner (1914-2010) is regarded as one of the world&#39;s leading experts on Lewis Carroll and his work. The author of more than a hundred books, he wrote the &#34;Mathematical Games&#34; column for Scientific American for twenty-five years and has been hailed by Douglas Hofstadter as &#34;one of the great intellects produced in this country in this century.&#34;&#34;A remarkable retrospective of [Gardner&#39;s] astonishingly influential career as an expositor extraordinaire.&#34;</p><h2>Madame Bovary (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p>Emma Bovary is beautiful and bored, trapped in her marriage to a mediocre doctor and stifled by the banality of provincial life. An ardent reader of sentimental novels, she longs for passion and seeks escape in fantasies of high romance, in voracious spending and, eventually, in adultery. But even her affairs bring her disappointment and devastating consequences. Flaubert's erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: "Madame Bovary, c'est moi." One of the greatest novels of the 19th century, Flaubert&#x2019;s torrid debut lives on in Geoffrey Wall&#x2019;s brilliant translation.&nbsp; This edition features an introduction by Wall, and a preface on Emma Bovary's femininity and modernity by novelist Michï¿½le Roberts.<br><br>Part of Penguin&#x2019;s beautiful hardcover Clothbound Classics series, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith, these delectable and collectible editions are bound in high-quality, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design.</p><p>Gustave Flaubert was born in Rouen in 1821. After illness interrupted a career in law, he retired to live with his widowed mother and devote himself to writing. His greatest works include Madame Bovary (1857), Sentimental Education (1857) and Bouvard et Pï¿½cuchet (1881). He achieved limited success in his own lifetime, but his fame and reputation grew steadily after his death in 1880. Geoffrey Wall is a literary biographer, translator and travel writer. His biography of Flaubert, published in 2001, was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize and for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. His translations of Flaubert for Penguin include Madame Bovary, Selected Letters, The Dictionary of Received Ideas, Sentimental Education and Three Tales. Michï¿½le Roberts is the half-English half-French writer of ten highly praised novels.<b>Chapter One</b>The uncouth schoolboy; The Bovary household; A mother's ambitions; Studies with the cure; Training for medicine; Student life in Rouen; Failure and success; A practice in Normandy; The bailiff's widow; The first Madame Bovary.<br><br>We were in the prep-room when the Head came in, followed by a new boy in mufti and a beadle carrying a big desk. The sleepers aroused themselves, and we all stood up, putting on a startled look, as if we had been buried in our work.<br><br>The Head motioned to us to sit down.<br><br>'Monsieur Roger,' said he in a quiet tone to the prep master, I've brought you a new boy. He's going into the second. If his conduct and progress are satisfactory, he will be put up with the boys of his own age. '<br><br>The new boy had kept in the background, in the corner behind the door, almost out of sight. He was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. His hair was clipped straight across the forehead, like a village choirboy's. He seemed a decent enough fellow, but horribly nervous. Although he was not broad across the shoulders, his green cloth jacket, with its black buttons, looked as if it pinched him under the arms and revealed, protruding well beyond the cuffs, a pair of raw, bony wrists, obviously not unaccustomed to exposure. His legs, encased in blue stockings, issued from a pair of drab-coloured breeches, very tightly braced. He had on a pair of thick, clumsy shoes, not particularly well cleaned and plentifully fortified with nails.<br><br>The master began to hear the boys at their work. The newcomer listened with all his ears, drinking it in as attentively as if he had been in church, not daring to cross his legs or to lean his elbows on the desk, and when two o'clock came and the bell rang for dismissal, the master had to call him back to earth and tell him to line up with the rest of us.<br><br>It was our custom, when we came in to class, to throw our caps on the floor, in order to have our hands free. As soon as ever we got inside the door, we 'buzzed' them under the form, against the wall, so as to kick up plenty of dust. That was supposed to be 'the thing.' Whether he failed to notice this manoeuvre or whether he was too shy to join in it, it is impossible to say, but when prayers were over he was still nursing his cap. That cap belonged to the composite order of headgear, and in it the heterogeneous characteristics of the busby, the Polish shapska, the bowler, the otterskin toque and the cotton nightcap were simultaneously represented. It was, in short, one of those pathetic objects whose mute unloveliness conveys the infinitely wistful expression we may sometimes note on the face of an idiot. Ovoid in form and stiffened with whalebone, it began with a sort of triple line of sausage-shaped rolls running all round its circumference; next, separated by a red band, came alternate patches of velvet and rabbit-skin; then a kind of bag or sack which culminated in a stiffened polygon elaborately embroidered, whence, at the end of a long, thin cord, hung a ball made out of gold wire, by way of a tassel. The cap was brand-new, and the peak of it all shiny.<br><br>'Stand up,' said the master.<br><br>He stood up, and down went his cap. The whole class began to laugh.<br><br>He bent down to recover it. One of the boys next to him jogged him with his elbow and knocked it down again. Again he stooped to pick it up.<br><br>'You may discard your helmet,' said the master, who had a pretty wit.<br><br>A shout of laughter from the rest of the class quite put the poor fellow out of countenance, and so flustered was he that he didn't know whether to keep it in his hand, put it on the floor or stick it on his head. He sat down and deposited it on his knees.<br><br>'Stand up,' said the master again, 'and tell me your name.'<br><br>In mumbling tones the new boy stammered out something quite unintelligible.<br><br>'Again!'<br><br>Again came the inarticulate mumble, drowned by the shouts of the class.<br><br>'Louder!' rapped out the master sharply. 'Speak up!'<br><br>Whereupon the boy, in desperation, opened his jaws as wide as they would go and, with the full force of his lungs, as though he were hailing somebody at a distance, fired off the word 'Charbovari.'<br><br>In an instant the class was in an uproar. The din grew louder and louder, a ceaseless crescendo crested with piercing yells--they shrieked, they howled, they stamped their feet, bellowing at the top of their voices: 'Charbovari! Charbovari!' Then, after a while, the storm began to subside. There would be sporadic outbreaks from time to time, smothered by a terrific effort, or perhaps a titter would fizz along a whole row, or a stifled explosion sputter out here and there, like a half-extinguished fuse.<br><br>However, beneath a hail of 'impositions,' order was gradually restored. The master--who had had it dictated, spelled out and read over to him--had at length succeeded in getting hold of the name of Charles Bovary, and forthwith he ordered the hapless wretch to go and sit on the dunce's stool, immediately below the seat of authority. He started to obey, stopped short and stood hesitating.<br><br>'What are you looking for?' said the master.<br><br>'My ca--' began the new boy timidly, casting an anxious glance around him.<br><br>An angry shout of 'Five hundred lines for the whole class' checked, like the <i>Quos ego,</i> a fresh outburst. 'Stop your noise, then, will you?' continued the master indignantly, mopping his brow with a handkerchief which he had produced from the interior of his cap.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Rick Owens</h2><p><b>The definitive monograph on the fashion of Rick Owens--one of the most daring and influential designers working today--this book documents over a decade of sublime, iconic styles.</b><br><br>Since the establishment of his label in 1994, Rick Owens has transformed global fashion with his provocative clothing and subversive style.

Somebody moved behind the brown door: first on the left, then on the right; first footsteps, then a muted rumpling of fabric and the clanking of pots; the concierge&#x2019;s grey eyes seemed to penetrate the wood in pursuit of the invisible noise. At last it drew near. The key turned. A rectangle of light appeared, a carpet of yellow flowers, the marble of a washstand. A man held out his hand, but the concierge didn&#x2019;t see it, or not clearly &#x2013; in any case, she wasn&#x2019;t paying attention. Her ferreting eyes had settled on another object: a towel soaked in blood, glaring deep red against the cold marble.</p><p>The door swung closed gently, of its own accord. The key turned again, and the concierge walked down the four flights of stairs, pausing now and then to think. She was thin; her clothes hung from her like a scarecrow&#x2019;s rags from its skeleton of sticks. Her nose was damp, her eyelids red, her hands chapped from the cold.</p><p>On the other side of the glass-paned door to the concierge&#x2019;s apartment, a young girl in flannel pyjamas stood in front of a chair with a shallow basin of water on it. Her brother, already dressed, was entertaining himself by splashing her; the table next to them had not been cleared.</p><p>Then came the distinct sound of the door opening. The boy turned around. The little girl exhibited a face drenched in tears.</p><p>&#x2018;What have we here ... ?&#x2019;</p><p>A slap for the boy, and his mother shoved him out the door.</p><p>&#x2018;You, off to school. And you, if you don&#x2019;t stop crying ...&#x2019;</p><p>She grabbed the girl and got her into her dress, tugging on her arms like on a marionette&#x2019;s.

Abridged 5 CD set. This is a story about a farm and its people, of a hilltop world in the 1930s in southwestern Wisconsin. Ben Logan grew up on a farm with his three brothers, father, mother, and farmhand Lyle, the fifth Logan boy, and marked the seasons by the demands of the land. The boys discussed and argued and joked over the events around their hilltop farm, testing each other and themselves as they learned the lessons of the farm and growing up. This beautiful story is now reunited with a never-before published Afterword that traces the land to an earlier time and brings the story full-circle to the farm and its people.</p><p>Ben Logan traveled as a merchant seaman, and worked many years as a novelist, producer and writer of films and television, and lecturer, while living forty miles north of New York City. Yet his roots remained in the southwestern driftless area of Wisconsin. He returned to his childhood farm, Seldom Seen, in the mid-1980s, and has lived there ever since. Ben was born and raised on the farm and attended Seneca High School before studying journalism at UW-Platteville and UW-Madison. He spent 4 1/2 years in the navy during WWII on amphibious landing craft in combat in North Africa and Italy. After the war, Ben worked as a merchant seaman in Europe and South America, then returned to Wisconsin to complete his master&#39;s degree. Further travels took him to Mexico to study anthropology and creative writing. In Mexico, he met his wife. From 1960-1985, Ben was senior producer for United Methodist Communications in New York state. He won an Emmy award for best-written documentary film, Taking Children Seriously, which aired on NBC-TV in 1986. UW-Platteville gave him the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1984. His book, The Land Remembers, was published in 1975, and is now in its eighth edition. It is something of a phenomenon, and has sold nearly half a million copies. In the latest edition, two original chapters have been reunited with the story, and included in a new Afterword that brings his story about growing up on a farm in the &#39;30s full-circle, back to the land and its people. The birth of that land, like the birth of the planet, is beyond our comprehension. We can theorize about cosmic dust, planetary collisions, rivers of molten rock, land rising out of the sea to be worn down again by wind and water, but how real is all that compared to the feel of the morning sun on the face, the smell of the seasons changing, the sight of the new green springing from the soil? Ben also wrote The Empty Meadow in 1983 and Christmas Remembered.Ben Logan traveled as a merchant seaman and worked many years as a novelist, producer and writer of films and television, and lecturer while living forty miles north of New York City.

Though an acquaintance with probability and statistics is helpful, it is not necessary. <b> </b> Providing a thorough, yet concise treatment of the phenomenological basis of thermal physics followed by a presentation of the statistical theory, this book presupposes no exposure to statistics or quantum mechanics. It covers several important topics, including a mathematically sound presentation of classical thermodynamics; the kinetic theory of gases including transport processes; and thorough, modern treatment of the thermodynamics of magnetism. It includes up-to-date examples of applications of the statistical theory, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, population inversions, and white dwarf stars. And, it also includes a chapter on the connection between thermodynamics and information theory. Standard International units are used throughout.<b> </b> An important reference book for every professional whose work requires and understanding of thermodynamics: from engineers to industrial designers.ï¿½ </p></p><p>Preface <p> This book is intended as a text for a one-semester undergraduate course in thermal physics. Its objective is to provide third- or fourth-year physics students with a solid introduction to the classical and statistical theories of thermodynamics. No preparation is assumed beyond college-level general physics and advanced calculus. An acquaintance with probability and statistics is helpful but is by no means necessary. </p><p> The current practice in many colleges is to offer a course in classical thermodynamics with little or no mention of the statistical theory&#x2014;or vice versa. The argument is that it is impossible to do justice to both in a one-semester course. On the basis of my own teaching experience, I strongly disagree. The standard treatment of temperature, work, heat, entropy, etc. often seems to the student like an endless collection of partial derivatives that shed only limited light on the underlying physics and can be abbreviated. The fundamental concepts of classical thermodynamics can easily be grasped in little more than half a semester, leaving ample time to gain a reasonably thorough understanding of the statistical method. </p><p> Since statistical thermodynamics subsumes the classical results, why not structure the entire course around the statistical approach? There are good reasons not to do so. The classical theory is general, simple, and direct, providing a kind of visceral, intuitive comprehension of thermal processes. The physics student not confronted with this remarkable phenomenological conception is definitely deprived. To be sure, the inadequacies of classical thermodynamics become apparent upon close scrutiny and invite inquiry about a more fundamental description. This, of course, exactly reflects the historical development of the subject. If only the statistical picture is presented, however, it is my observation that the student fails to appreciate fully its more abstract concepts, given no exposure to the related classical ideas first. Not only do classical and statistical thermodynamics in this sense complement each other, they also beautifully illustrate the physicist's perpetual striving for descriptions of greater power, elegance, universality, and freedom from ambiguity. </p><p> Chapters 1 through 10 represent a fairly traditional introduction to the classical theory. Early on emphasis is placed on the advantages of expressing the fundamental laws in terms of state variables, quantities whose differentials are exact. Accordingly, the search for integrating factors for the differentials of work and heat is discussed. The elaboration of the first law is followed by chapters on applications and consequences. Entropy is presented both as a useful mathematical variable and as a phenomenological construct necessary to explain why there are processes permitted by the first law that do not occur in nature. Calculations are then given of the change in entropy for various reversible and irreversible processes. The thermodynamic potentials are broached via the Legendre transformation following elucidation of the rationale for having precisely four such quantities. The conditions for stable equilibrium are examined in a section that rarely appears in undergraduate texts. Modifications of fundamental relations to deal with open systems are treated in Chapter 9 and the third law is given its due in Chapter 10. </p><p> The kinetic theory of gases, treated in Chapter 11, is concerned with the molecular basis of such thermodynamic properties of gases as the temperature, pressure, and thermal energy. It represents, both logically and historically, the transition between classical thermodynamics and the statistical theory. </p><p> The underlying principles of equilibrium statistical thermodynamics are introduced in Chapter 12 through consideration of a simple coin-tossing experiment. The basic concepts are then defined. The statistical interpretation of a system containing many molecules is observed to require a knowledge of the properties of the individual molecules making up the system. This information is furnished by the quantum mechanical notions of energy levels, quantum states, and intermolecular forces. In Chapter 13, the explication of classical and quantum statistics and the derivation of the particle distribution functions is based on the method of Lagrange multipliers. A discussion of the connection between classical and statistical thermodynamics completes the development of the mathematical formulation of the statistical theory. Chapter 14 is devoted to the statistics of an ideal gas. Chapters 15 through 19 present important examples of the application of the statistical method. The last chapter introduces the student to the basic ideas of information theory and offers the intriguing thought that statistical thermodynamics is but a special case of some deeper, more far-reaching set of physical principles. </p><p> Throughout the book a serious attempt has been made to keep the level of the chapters as uniform as possible. On the other hand, the problems are intended to vary somewhat more widely in difficulty. </p><p> In preparing the text, my greatest debt is to my students, whose response has provided a practical filter for the refinement of the material presented herein. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> In addition to my students at Drew University, I owe thanks to two colleagues and friends, Professors Robert Fenstermacher and John Ollom, who have encouraged me at every turn during the writing of this book. I am indebted to Professor Mark Raizin of the University of Texas at Austin, who reviewed the manuscript and used it as the text in his thermal physics course; his comments were invaluable. </p><p> I am especially grateful to Professor Roy S.

Governments must reduce debt at all cost if they want to restore confidence and get back on a path to prosperity. Maurizio Lazzarato's diagnosis, however, is completely different: under capitalism, debt is not primarily a question of budget and economic concerns but a political relation of subjection and enslavement. Debt has become infinite and unpayable. It disciplines populations, calls for structural reforms, justifies authoritarian crackdowns, and even legitimizes the suspension of democracy in favor of &#x201c;technocratic governments&#x201d; beholden to the interests of capital. The 2008 economic crisis only accelerated the establishment of a &#x201c;new State capitalism,&#x201d; which has carried out a massive confiscation of societies' wealth through taxes. And who benefits? Finance capital. In a calamitous return to the situation before the two world wars, the entire process of accumulation is now governed by finance, which has absorbed sectors it once ignored, like higher education, and today is often identified with life itself. Faced with the current catastrophe and the disaster to come, Lazzarato contends, we must overcome capitalist valorization and reappropriate our existence, knowledge, and technology.</p><p>In <i>Governing by Debt</i>, Lazzarato confronts a wide range of thinkers&#x2015;from Fï¿½lix Guattari and Michel Foucault to David Graeber and Carl Schmitt&#x2015;and draws on examples from the United States and Europe to argue that it is time that we unite in a collective refusal of this most dire status quo.</p></p><p>Maurizio Lazzarato is a sociologist and philosopher in Paris. He is the author of <i>Governing by Debt</i> and <i>Signs and Machines: Capitalism and the Production of Subjectivity</i>, both published by Semiotext(e).</p><h2>Evolution in Four Dimensions: Genetic, Epigenetic, Behavioral, and Symbolic Variation in the History of Life (Life And Mind: Philosophical Issues in Biology And Philosophy Series)</h2><p><p>Ideas about heredity and evolution are undergoing a revolutionary change. New findings in molecular biology challenge the gene-centered version of Darwinian theory according to which adaptation occurs only through natural selection of chance DNA variations. In Evolution in Four Dimensions, Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb argue that there is more to heredity than genes. They trace four "dimensions" in evolution -- four inheritance systems that play a role in evolution: genetic, epigenetic (or non-DNA cellular transmission of traits), behavioral, and symbolic (transmission through language and other forms of symbolic communication). These systems, they argue, can all provide variations on which natural selection can act. Evolution in Four Dimensions offers a richer, more complex view of evolution than the gene-based, one-dimensional view held by many today. The new synthesis advanced by Jablonka and Lamb makes clear that induced and acquired changes also play a role in evolution.After discussing each of the four inheritance systems in detail, Jablonka and Lamb "put Humpty Dumpty together again" by showing how all of these systems interact. They consider how each may have originated and guided evolutionary history and they discuss the social and philosophical implications of the four-dimensional view of evolution. Each chapter ends with a dialogue in which the authors engage the contrarieties of the fictional (and skeptical) "I.M.," or Ifcha Mistabra -- Aramaic for "the opposite conjecture" -- refining their arguments against I.M.'s vigorous counterarguments. The lucid and accessible text is accompanied by artist-physician Anna Zeligowski's lively drawings, which humorously and effectively illustrate the authors' points.</p></p><p>Eva Jablonka is Professor at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. Jablonka and Lamb are also the authors of <i> Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution</i>.<br><br>Marion J. Lamb was Senior Lecturer at Birkbeck College, University of London, before her retirement. Jablonka and Lamb are also the authors of <i> Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution</i><p>"An individual's personal experience can influence the characteristics of his or her offspring. Some of the ways in which this happens would have seemed heretical in the past. Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb's stimulating new book successfully challenges some of the old orthodoxies. I recommend it warmly to anybody with a serious interest in developmental and evolutionary biology."--Sir Patrick Bateson, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, author of *Design for a Life: How Behavior and Personality Develop*</p><br><br><p>"Another valuable perspective to the discussion... I found it refreshing to read a science book that is a conscious attempt at good literature." Nature</p><br><br><p>"As this important book by Eva Jablonka and Marion J. Lamb shows, the twentieth-century 'neo-Darwins' told the evolutionary story in their own particular way, and some of the richnes of evolution that their forebear had described fell into neglect." <i>The New Republic</i></p><br><br><p>"There have been rumblings for some time to the effect that the neo-Darwinian synthesis of the early twentieth century is incomplete and due for a major revision.... Evolution in Four Dimensions is the most recent addition to this genre, and contributes yet another valuable perspective to the discussion." <b>Massimo Pigliucci </b> <i>Nature</i></p></p><h2>McSorley&#39;s Wonderful Saloon</h2><p><br>&#x201c;Mitchell&#x2019;s collection of portraits is the exact opposite of the books that choose an important subject, but are hastily written and have nothing much to say. These books, which form the bulk of current writing, always make you feel as if you had paid for looking into the wrong end of a telescope. Mitchell, on the other hand, likes to start with an unimportant hero, but he collects all the facts about him, arranges them to give the desired effects, and usually ends by describing the customs of a whole community. Commodore Dutch, the subject of one portrait, &#x2018;is a brassy little man who has made a living for the last forty years by giving an annual ball for the benefit of himself.&#x2019; Mitchell doesn&#x2019;t try to present him as anything more than a barroom scrounger; but in telling the story of his career, he also gives a picture of New York sporting life since the days of Big Tim Sullivan. The story called &#x2018;King of the Gypsies&#x2019; is even better. It sets out to describe Cockeye Johnny Nikanov, the spokesman or king of thirty-eight gypsy families, but it soon becomes a Gibbon&#x2019;s decline and fall of the American gypsies; and it ends with an apocalyptic vision that is not only comic but also, in its proper context, more imaginative than anything to be found in recent novels. <br> &#x201c;Reading some of his portraits a second time, you catch an emotion beneath them that curiously resembles Dickens&#x2019;: a continual wonder at the sights and sounds of a big city, a continual devouring interest in all the strange people who live there, a continual impulse to burst into praise of kind hearts and good food and down with hypocrisy.&#x201d; &#x2014;Malcolm Cowley, <i>The New Republic</i></p><p>Joseph Mitchell came to New York City on October 25, 1929 (the day after the stock-market crash), from a small farming town called Fairmont, in the swamp country of southeastern North Carolina. He was twenty-one years old and looking for a job as a newspaper reporter. He eventually managed to find work as an apprentice crime reporter at Police Headquarters for <i>The World</i>. He was a reporter and feature writer&#x2014;for <i>The World</i>, <i>The Herald Tribune</i>, and <i>The World-Telegram</i>&#x2014;for eight years, and then went to <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he remained until his death, on May 24, 1996, at the age of eighty-seven. <br><br>Aside from writing, Mr. Mitchell&#x2019;s interests included the waterfront of New York City, commercial fishing, gypsies, Southern agriculture, Irish literature, and the architecture of New York City. He served several terms on the board of directors of the Gypsy Lore Society, an international organization of students of gypsy life and the gypsy language, which was founded in England in 1888. <i>Bajour</i>, a musical comedy based on stories about gypsies by Mitchell, ran for 232 performances on Broadway in 1964-65. He was one of the founders of the South Street Seaport Museum and one of the original members of the Friends of Cast-Iron Architecture. For five years he was also one of the Commissioners of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. <br><br>Mr. Mitchell was married to the photographer Therese Mitchell, who died in 1980; they had two daughters, Nora Sanborn and Elizabeth Mitchell."I don't think anything could be as much fun as to get a good hold on a pompous person and shake him or her until you can hear the false teeth rattling," says New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno to journalist Mitchell in a World-Telegram profile from the 1930s, but the sentiment could be applied to Mitchell himself. With the ability to turn bluntness to beauty, sarcasm to sincerity and plain speech to poetry, Mitchell who worked at the World-Telegram from 1930 to 1938 and spent the rest of his career at the New Yorker was a reporter and literary artist par excellence, interested in nearly everyone and everything. His profile of a stripper who begins naked and puts on her clothes is as fascinating as his sketch of George Bernard Shaw. Similarly, he is as empathetic toward Mary Louise Cecilia Guinan (the speakeasy queen usually called "Texas") as he is to the plight of Anne Morrow Lindbergh testifying at the kidnapping trial of her infant son. These 37 pieces and profiles most from the 1938 edition of this book, but with some new material added are breathtaking in their simplicity and honesty. Written at a time when newspapers tried to be as sensational as possible without appearing vulgar "belly" would be changed to "tummy" and "raped" became "criminally attacked" Mitchell made New York City shockingly vibrant and colorful without cheapening his subjects. He also evinced an empathy for African-Americans that's startling for the period (and the genre). In all, his liberating and refreshing honesty makes these pieces as vivacious, original and important as they were 65 years ago. <p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Little Edges (Wesleyan Poetry Series)</h2><p><b>Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship (2016)</b><br><br>The Little Edges is a collection of poems that extends poet Fred Moten's experiments in what he calls "shaped prose"&#x2015;a way of arranging prose in rhythmic blocks, or sometimes shards, in the interest of audio-visual patterning. Shaped prose is a form that works the "little edges" of lyric and discourse, and radiates out into the space between them. As occasional pieces, many of the poems in the book are the result of a request or commission to comment upon a work of art, or to memorialize a particular moment or person. In Moten's poems, the matter and energy of a singular event or person are transformed by their entrance into the social space that they, in turn, transform.

He is the author of Arkansas, Poems (with Jim Behrle), I ran from it but was still in it, Hughson&#39;s Tavern, B Jenkins, The Feel Trio, and the critical works In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition and The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study (with Stefano Harney)."In [Moten's poetry], he gathers the sources running through his head and transforms them into something musical, driven by the material of language itself. The poem 'all topological last friday evening,' collected in Moten's 2015 book, The Little Edges, ... unfolds as a chain of references, from free-jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler to&nbsp;Andrew Marvell. We may not know exactly how we moved from one to the other, but there's pleasure in getting lost in the dance."&#x2015;David Wallace, <i>The New Yorker</i><p>"With its jazz exuberance, the book has the maverick spirit of one of its heroes, the multi-media artist Ralph Lemon: no hierarchy, no fluidity, no care-ridden pursuit of time, just bold, wild, delirious genius Moten is intent above all on not being anybody's 'Project.' Anarchronistically whimsical and erotic, his writing consolidates the spirit of jazz well beyond the aim and resources of a Langston Hughes or even an Amiri Baraka. But like Baraka he's a teacher; he instructs as well as delights."&#x2015;Calvin Bedient, <i>Lana Turner Journal</i></p><p>"The poetic vision, or sound, of The Little Edges is remarkable in its range of reference, deep music, surprise at every turn, softness of lyric address coupled with political meditation, and undeniable beauty."&#x2015;Maggie Nelson, author of Bluets and The Art of Cruelty: A Reckoning</p><p>"Moten experiments in 'shaped prose' arranging words in rhythmic blocks, shards and in audio-visual patterns."&#x2015;Molly McArdle, <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"Skins and minds are among the central concerns of the voices of The Little Edges. Their chunks and fragments mostly focus on listening, though, as a way of getting beneath skins and minds and beyond the rhetoric about them."&#x2015;T.C. Marshall, <i>American Book Review</i></p><p>"Through the interplay of enjambment and parenthesis, the poem pushes us to ponder the appositional relation between making, doing, and having The Little Edges expands Moten's concern for poetry's worlding capacities by placing the reader in the liminal spaces of language and meaning, in the marginal positions suggested by the collection's title."&#x2015;Gerï¿½nimo Sarmiento Cruz, <i>Chicago Review</i></p><p>"In its extravagance, Africa-American music can elicit a heightened kinship with its listeners, by turns sensuous or politicized (sometimes both at once) and suffused with pleasure, joy, deep feeling, resistance. Moten aims to do likewise, using mere words, their sounds, and the visual rhythms of the black-and-white page."&#x2015;James Gibbons, <i>Hyperallergic</i></p><p>"Moten pays homage to jazz history, poetry history, and the illimitable future of the imagination in works organized less autonomous poems than in page-length lines, blocks of text, and short riffs."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"The poems in The Little Edges work the margins of language&#x2015;the African American vernacular with its powerfully kinetic resources as well as the more elevated and elegant language of the academy&#x2015;blending and juxtaposing them in ways that result in an utterly fresh poetic idiom."&#x2015;M. NourbeSe Philip, author of Zong!</p><p>"Moten's work is free speech in the best sense&#x2015;musical but with heft&#x2015;and will appeal to those who prefer their poetry to be 'beyond category'."&#x2015;Chris Pusateri, <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"Sometimes Moten is riding a wave of sound It's like you're walking by a practice room and someone is improvising on the saxophone, lost to the music, and it's so clear and haunting and beautiful, you can't not stop and listen."&#x2015;Joy Katz, <i>American Poetry Review</i></p><p>"In [Moten's poetry], he gathers the sources running through his head and transforms them into something musical, driven by the material of language itself.

The stance of his poems is grassroots revolutionary: undoing by means of the everyday, the super-powerful default settings of a corporatized world and thereby reopening the case for what the world of poetry might look and feel like."&#x2015;Elizabeth Willis, <i>Boston Review</i></p></p><h2>Jane and Prudence</h2><p>This early novel by Barbara Pym captures the charm and folly of English middle-class life.

Gravetter, and co-author Lori-Ann B. Forzano have written a text for research methods that helps students see how interesting and exciting experimental and non-experimental research can be. Inviting and conversational, RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, Fourth Edition, leads students through the research process from start to finish. The text opens with tips and strategies for generating research ideas, moves to selecting measures and participants, and then offers an examination of research strategy and design. This step-by-step approach emphasizes the decisions researchers must make at each stage of the process. The authors avoid a &#34;cookbook&#34; approach to the facts by linking terminology with applied concepts; their &#34;lecture in a book&#34; style makes the text accessible to students by emphasizing discussion and explanation of topics. Each chapter ends with a set of student exercises and activities. Examples and content throughout the book reflect the most current APA guidelines.</p><p>Frederick J Gravetter is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at The College at Brockport, State University of New York College.

The style is informal, the discussions are fairly clear, and the level of detail is necessary in order to fully grasp the content."<br><br>"The book reads more like a lecture than a textbook, which is a plus. Often, undergraduate methods books are dry and use language and descriptions that tend to irk undergraduate readers. Students could benefit greatly from a methods textbook that uses this approach."<br><br>"I certainly believe that this book is easier to read than other texts that I have used in the past. The text reads smoothly, is accurate, and is understandable.

Cunliffe views Europe not in terms of states and shifting political land boundaries but as a geographical niche particularly favored in facing many seas. These seas, and Europe&#x2019;s great transpeninsular rivers, ensured a rich diversity of natural resources while also encouraging the dynamic interaction of peoples across networks of communication and exchange. The development of these early Europeans is rooted in complex interplays, shifting balances, and geographic and demographic fluidity.</p><p>Drawing on archaeology, anthropology, and history, Cunliffe has produced an interdisciplinary tour de force. His is a bold book of exceptional scholarship, erudite and engaging, and it heralds an entirely new understanding of Old Europe.</p></p><p><b>Barry Cunliffe</b> is one of the most important and distinguished archaeologists in Europe.

Or was it something deeper&#x2014;a creative impulse, a spiritual dawn, a shamanistic conception of the world efflorescing in the dark, dank spaces beneath the surface of the earth where the spirits were literally at hand?<br> <br> In this book, Jean Clottes, one of the most renowned figures in the study of cave paintings, pursues an answer to this &#x201c;why&#x201d; of Paleolithic art. While other books focus on particular sites and surveys, Clottes&#x2019;s work is a contemplative journey across the world, a personal reflection on how we have viewed these paintings in the past, what we learn from looking at them across geographies, and what these paintings may have meant&#x2014;what function they may have served&#x2014;for their artists. Steeped in Clottes&#x2019;s shamanistic theories of cave painting, <i>What Is Paleolithic Art?</i> travels from well-known Ice Age sites like Chauvet, Altamira, and Lascaux to visits with contemporary aboriginal artists, evoking a continuum between the cave paintings of our prehistoric past and the living rock art of today. Clottes&#x2019;s work lifts us from the darkness of our Paleolithic origins to reveal, by firelight, how we think, why we create, why we believe, and who we are.</p></p><p><b>Jean Clottes </b>is a prominent French archaeologist and former general inspector for archaeology and scientific advisor for prehistoric art at the French Ministry of Culture. He is the author of <i>Cave Art</i>, among other books. <b>Oliver Y. Martin </b>is a lecturer in the Department of Environmental Systems Science at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.<b> Robert D. Martin</b> is curator emeritus in the Integrative Research Center at the Field Museum, Chicago.&#x201c;It is shamanism that, according to Clottes, is the key to understanding the Paleolithic practices of what he calls <i>Homo spiritualis</i>, who chose to descend into the underworld, seek a trance state, and enter into contact with spirits.&#x201d; (<i>Le Monde, on the French edition</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;What gives this art its power, Clottes says, is that it makes us dream.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Subtle, imaginative, and brilliantly accomplished, the images of animals and humans found in caves and dated from the end of the last Ice Age, between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago, continue to astonish us. The emotions and motives that inspired them beg to be understood. In <i>What is Paleolithic Art?</i>, Clottes, the renowned cave- and rock-art specialist, suggests some answers. . . . This is a thought-provoking book about complex societies that endeavored to understand the world in their own various ways. For anyone interested in Ice Age art, Clottes&#x2019;s enthusiasm cannot fail to energize, inspire, and provide caution to their own investigations.&#x201d; (Jill Cook, British Museum <i>Nature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Clottes has been looking at and thinking about the cave paintings of ice age Europe for almost half a century. I can&#x2019;t imagine anyone has a greater knowledge about the paintings, carvings, sculptures, and their associated archaeology than this great prehistorian. It&#x2019;s not just greater knowledge, but an emotional response: I&#x2019;ve seen tears come into his eyes as he was describing a painting that he must have seen and talked about many times before, and that still tugged at his heart as much as his brain. Clottes&#x2019;s enormous depth of learning and affection emanate from every page of this book.&#x201d; (Steven Mithen, University of Reading <i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The deep understanding, love, and empathy that Clottes has for the art, imagination, and spiritual world of our Ice Age ancestors is so great that this book is a must-read.&#x201d; (Lawrence Guy Strauss, University of New Mexico <i>Journal of Anthropological Research, on the French edition</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Clottes explores why prehistoric people took to cave painting and speculates on what the art means.&#x201d; (Jeremy Mikula <i>Chicago Tribune, Printers Row</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Clottes is the leading Paleolithic archaeologist and perhaps the most famous archaeologist in the world. This alone makes <i>What Is Paleolithic Art?</i> noteworthy. But the topic is also one that generates interest beyond the archaeological profession, especially inasmuch as his expansive discussion emphasizes shamanism as the likely origin for this art, and partly bases this conclusion on comparisons and analogies with ethnographic cases. . . . Very readable and appealing.&#x201d; (David S. Whitley, author of "Cave Paintings and the Human Spirit: The Origin of Creativity and Belief")<br><br>&#x201c;Clottes has probably seen more rock art around the world than anyone else, and this gives him an unusually broad perspective on the questions raised by the prehistoric cave art of his native France. Not everyone agrees with the shamanistic interpretations toward which he leans, but this very accessible discussion of both French cave art specifically and of rock art in general is wide-ranging, and his is certainly a point of view which anyone interested in Paleolithic art should know about.&#x201d; (Ian Tattersall, author of "The Strange Case of the Rickety Cossack and Other Cautionary Tales from Human Evolution")<br><br>&#x201c;Clottes&#x2019; book is . . . rich in content: a fascinating muse on his personal research, career, and travels, an attempt not just to explain where, when and how Paleolithic people created art, but why. Clottes seeks to enter the minds of these people, as well as their caves, and to explore what it is to be human.

In this latest offering he tackles the question of &#x2018;why&#x2019; not just &#x2018;what.&#x2019; This is a great leap for most archaeologists, who prefer to describe what they can see and hold in their hands, rather than the nebulous realms of dreams and thoughts behind the works. Stepping beyond the traditional realm of archaeology, Clottes takes the reader on a worldwide journey from well-known Ice Age sites such as Chauvet and Lascaux to the work of contemporary aboriginal artists, tracing some of the earliest examples of human creativity in the shamanistic tradition of <i>Homo spiritualis</i>&nbsp;(man the spiritual being) rather than homo faber&nbsp;(man the toolmaker). Though not all readers will agree with the author&#x2019;s interpretation of the shamanistic art of rock art, the theory is credible.&nbsp;This readable and appealing translation is a must for those serious about archaeology or art history.

Borrowing from the legal notion of &#39;gender entrapment&#39;, Beth Richie details the ways in which African American women are hemmed into the corners of U.S. society by virtue of their vulnerability to men&#39;s violence, and penalized for behaviors that are prescribed by societal mores of appropriate gender roles. Often misrepresented and misunderstood, these women have been physically battered, sexually assaulted, and emotionally abused. These devastating circumstances represent a position from which there is little escape. Desperation leads them into illegal activities, and the cycle is only perpetuated by a legal system that continues to penalize these women and deny them access to the counseling and services they so desperately need to change their lives.</p><p>While African Americans consider how to accommodate participation in the feminist and black nationalist movements, Richie has taken on one of the most contested issues within the community: African American women battered by African American men. For her study, Richie concentrates on a group of 37 women detained at Rikers Island, who come from a background of poverty and physical and emotional abuse. Richie claims that their experiences represent the extreme of what many African American women undergo as a result of marginalization and hard choices. Throughout she emphasizes her theory of gender entrapment, whereby society provides these women?most of whom want to conform to societal norms?with no socially acceptable way to change their position, making incarceration almost inevitable. Many of the interviewees were determined not to speak out against African American men, believing that their partners already have fewer opportunities than they do. Others believe that, having participated in criminal acts, they are prohibited from taking advantage of social programs designed to help battered women. Although often academically dry and statistical, Richie's book still allows ample room for the women's compelling life histories. She does not, however, offer suggestions for solutions. Hope doesn't illuminate this book?just cold, hard facts. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc."The specific foux of the justice system's influence on black female vulnerablity makes for an unusually exact title which analyzes male violence, penalties for women's actions, and paths which lead to crime.

This story has been suppressed for half a century.

This book examines the insurgence of democratic citizenship in the urban peripheries of Sï¿½o Paulo, Brazil, its entanglement with entrenched systems of inequality, and its contradiction in violence.</p><p> James Holston argues that for two centuries Brazilians have practiced a type of citizenship all too common among nation-states--one that is universally inclusive in national membership and massively inegalitarian in distributing rights and in its legalization of social differences. But since the 1970s, he shows, residents of Brazil's urban peripheries have formulated a new citizenship that is destabilizing the old. Their mobilizations have developed not primarily through struggles of labor but through those of the city--particularly illegal residence, house building, and land conflict. Yet precisely as Brazilians democratized urban space and achieved political democracy, violence, injustice, and impunity increased dramatically. Based on comparative, ethnographic, and historical research, <i>Insurgent Citizenship</i> reveals why the insurgent and the entrenched remain dangerously conjoined as new kinds of citizens expand democracy even as new forms of violence and exclusion erode it.</p><p> Rather than view this paradox as evidence of democratic failure and urban chaos, <i>Insurgent Citizenship</i> argues that contradictory realizations of citizenship characterize all democracies--emerging and established. Focusing on processes of city- and citizen-making now prevalent globally, it develops new approaches for understanding the contemporary course of democratic citizenship in societies of vastly different cultures and histories.</p></p><p><p>"Through a masterful blending of history and ethnography, James Holston offers his readers an innovative and compelling way to think about citizenship in Brazil and elsewhere. <i>Insurgent Citizenship</i> shows how, historically, the category of 'citizen' in Brazilian society has been subject to differential rights and subtle gradations that have forced many people who enjoy formal citizenship to resort to illegal arrangements to survive. Perhaps most important, Holston analyzes the struggles of insurgent movements in Brazil's urban 'peripheries' not only to claim inclusion but to reshape the very meaning of citizenship."<b>--Barbara Weinstein, New York University</b></p><p>"James Holston has written a landmark book. In this multilayered study, Holston has written an explosive history of modern citizenship. The implications of his work provide fresh insights in Brazilian democracy and its limitations--and suggest ways in which, in fact, Brazil may not be so unique in a world of legalized privileges and legitimated inequalities. A monumental achievement of engaged scholarship."<b>--Jeremy Adelman, author of <i>Sovereignty and Revolution in the Iberian Atlantic</i></b></p><p>"This is a major book, and should provoke significant debate among Brazilianists and beyond. Holston offers a thoroughly researched, acutely argued, and well-written account of the emergence of a new understanding of citizenship in Brazil. He grounds his account of 'insurgent citizenship' in the study of neighborhood activism in two working-class neighborhoods on the periphery of Sï¿½o Paulo, Jardim das Camï¿½lias and Lar Nacional. His analysis of the former, in particular, is stunning."<b>--Bryan McCann, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"This magnificent, richly detailed study of the emergence of an idea of the citizen as a rights-bearing subject, out of the morass of legal and social inequalities that have characterized Brazilian society since its inception, offers a provocative view of what democracy and rights mean for diminishing such inequalities. The developments in Brazil are similar to those taking place elsewhere in Latin America, and this book shows us in vivid detail why they are happening and what their implications might be."<b>--Sally Engle Merry, New York University</b></p><p>"One of the best books I've ever read on Brazil or on citizenship."<b>--Margaret Keck, Johns Hopkins University</b></p><b>James Holston</b> is professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley.

Developed by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) with contributions from a specialized team of experts, this text presents a framework for optimizing patients&#x2019; and clients&#x2019; functionality by keeping them physically active. Featuring new content on common comorbid conditions, this edition is streamlined and updated to better suit chronic populations. </p><p> This fourth edition of <i>ACSM's Exercise Management for Persons With Chronic Diseases and Disabilities</i> outlines why exercise is significant in the treatment and prevention of disease, advises medical and exercise professionals in considering proper exercise prescription protocols, and provides evidence-informed guidance on devising individualized exercise programs. </p><p> Major advancements and features of the fourth edition include the following: </p><p> ï¿½ Current evidence on exercise management for persons with multiple conditions, providing guidance on working with these common yet complex populations </p><p> ï¿½ A refocused goal of using physical activity to optimize patients&#x2019; and clients&#x2019; functionality and participation in life activities rather than only to treat and prevent disease </p><p> ï¿½ Specific content to help physicians prescribe physical activity and exercise to patients for promotion of health, well-being, and longevity </p><p> ï¿½ Reorganization of case studies into one streamlined chapter along with commentary from the senior editor to encourage critical thinking and recognize the unique needs of each patient </p><p> The case studies in the text are real-life scenarios that help professionals and clinicians combine scientific knowledge with experience to find appropriate solutions for each individual.

Although Flush has adventures of his own with bullying dogs, horrid maids, and robbers, he also provides the reader with a glimpse into Browning&#x2019;s life. Introduction by Trekkie Ritchie.<br></p><p>VIRGINIA WOOLF (1882&#x2013;1941) was&nbsp;one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century. An admired literary critic, she authored many essays, letters, journals, and short stories in addition to her groundbreaking novels.A novel contribution to Browning material, which will interest anyone who saw THE BARRETTS OF WIMPOLE STREET, anyone who is collecting Browning data, and most people who like to read about dogs. For with the slenderest material to work on, Miss Woolf has produced a sympathetic study of the famous spaniel, and made him a real and vivid personality. First owned by Miss Mitford, he roamed the country at will; after he was given to Miss Barrett, he settled down into the role of invalid's dog. When Robert Browning appeared on the scene, he showed keen resentment at sharing his mistress' attention, but eventually accepted him as inevitable. The move to Italy was a ticket to freedom. Though essentially Flush's story, Virginia Woolf has given interesting sidelights on the Brownings and those associated with them, and she has told it in her most delightful style, devoid of the indirection and obscurity of most of her fiction.

Even under the Protestantism of the reformed Church, the spiritual and social dramas of birth, marriage, and death were graced with elaborate ceremony. Powerful and controversial protocols were in operation, shaped and altered by the influences of the Reformation, the Revolution, and the Restoration. <br> <br> Each of the major rituals was potentially an arena for argument, ambiguity, and dissent. Ideally, as classic rites of passage, these ceremonies worked to bring people together. But they also set up traps into which people could stumble, and tests which not everybody could pass. In practice, ritual performance revealed frictions and fractures that everyday local discourse attempted to hide or to heal.<br> Using fascinating first-hand evidence, David Cressy shows how the making and remaking of ritual formed part of a continuing debate, sometimes strained and occasionally acrimonious, which exposed the raw nerves of society in the midst of great historical events. In doing so, he vividly brings to life the common experiences of living and dying in Tudor and Stuart England.<br></p><p>From childbirth and baptism through to courtship, weddings, and funerals, every stage in the life-cycle of Tudor and Stuart England was accompanied by ritual.

In a seedy apartment house nearby lives pasty, fat Mr. Hire. Mr. Hire, who earns his living through a petty postal scam, is a convicted pornographer, a peeping Tom, and, once a week, the unlikely star of a Parisian bowling club, where people think he works for the police. He is a faceless man of regular habits who keeps to himself and gives his neighbors the creeps. After the murder, Mr. Hire&#x2019;s concierge points a finger at him: he was out late the night of the crime. The police have the suspect under 24-hour surveillance. They are only waiting for him to make the inevitable mistake and give himself away. <br><br>Except that creepy Mr. Hire is in fact an innocent man, whose only mistake is to have fallen head-over-heels in love with the wrong girl. <br><br>One of the most chilling and compassionate of Simenon&#x2019;s extraordinary psychological novels, <b>The Engagement</b> explores the mystery of a blameless heart in a compromised soul.</p><p><b>Georges Simenon</b> (1903&#x2014;1989) was born in Liege, Belgium. He started working as a reporter at the age of fifteen and by the end of his life had published hundreds of novels under his own name and sundry pseudonyms. Renowned all over the world for his series of mysteries featuring Inspector Maigret, Simenon was also the author of many psychological novels. <i>The Engagement</i> is one of eight novels by Simenon published by NYRB Classics. <br><br><b>John Gray</b> is Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics.

In 2005 she translated <i>The Authentic Bistros of Paris</i> for The Little Bookroom. She teaches Comparative Literature at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York City.&nbsp;"Published when Europe was between the wars, the novel depicts the impoverished City of Light as a moral vortex where truth isn&#x2019;t as highly valued as survival. As with all of the hard novels,<i> The Engagement</i> is considerably more complex than most existential thrillers. Gripping, too&#x2014;you&#x2019;d have to scan the rest of the Simenon shelf to find a more engrossing beach read." --<i>Time Out New York</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a quietly compelling story with no hero, no villain and no justice&#x2013;just the inevitability of fate.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Simenon is best-known for his Inspector Maigret mysteries. But he also wrote what he called romans dur - "hard novels," unblinkingly realistic psychological studies. <i>The Engagement</i>, first published in 1933, is one of the earliest of these...it is a mark of Simenon's artistry that he can devise so compelling a tale." --<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br>&#x201c;Attention should be paid to the New York Review of Books' continuing reissues of Georges Simenon. Simenon was legendary both for his literary skill&#x2013;four or five books every year for 40 years&#x2013;and his sexual capacity, at least to hear him tell it. What we can speak of with some certainty are the novels, which are tough, rigorously unsentimental and full of rage, duplicity and, occasionally, justice. Simenon's tone and dispassionate examination of humanity was echoed by Patricia Highsmith, who dispensed with the justice. So far, the Review has published <i>Tropic Moon, The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, Red Lights, Dirty Snow </i>and <i>Three Bedrooms in Manhattan</i>; <i>The Strangers in the House</i> comes out in November.

Hamilton, Wall Street&#39;s First Black Millionaire</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2015 Society for Historians of the Early American Republic Best Book Prize</b></p><p>In the middle decades of the nineteenth century Jeremiah G. Hamilton was a well-known figure on Wall Street. Cornelius Vanderbilt, America's first tycoon, came to respect, grudgingly, his one-time opponent. The day after Vanderbilt's death on January 4, 1877, an almost full-page obituary on the front of the <i>National Republican</i> acknowledged that, in the context of his Wall Street share transactions, "There was only one man who ever fought the Commodore to the end, and that was Jeremiah Hamilton." </p><p>What Vanderbilt's obituary failed to mention, perhaps as contemporaries already knew it well, was that Hamilton was African American. Hamilton, although his origins were lowly, possibly slave, was reportedly the richest colored man in the United States, possessing a fortune of $2 million, or in excess of two hundred and $50 million in today's currency. </p><p>In <i>Prince of Darkness, </i>a groundbreaking and vivid account, eminent historian Shane White reveals the larger than life story of a man who defied every convention of his time. He wheeled and dealed in the lily white business world, he married a white woman, he bought a mansion in rural New Jersey, he owned railroad stock on trains he was not legally allowed to ride, and generally set his white contemporaries teeth on edge when he wasn't just plain outsmarting them. An important contribution to American history, Hamilton's life offers a way into considering, from the unusual perspective of a black man, subjects that are usually seen as being quintessentially white, totally segregated from the African American past.</p></p><p><b>SHANE WHITE</b> is the Challis Professor of History and an Australian Professorial Fellow in the History Department at the University of Sydney specializing in African-American history.

From the islands of the Caribbean to Gotham, Hamilton welded together grit and intellectual agility that propelled him into unimaginable wealth.

Here Shakespeare&#x2019;s best-known tragedies and comedies come to life.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In the twenty tales told in this book, Charles &amp; Mary Lamb succeeded in paraphrasing the language of truly adult literature in children's terms. Let us not underestimate young readers: they love a complex story with many and varied characters, twists of plot, and turns of fate as much as anyone &#x2014; but they draw the line at reading in unfamiliar language.

He serves as a chaplain&#39;s assistant in World War II, is captured by the Germans, and he survives the largest massacre in European history the fire bombing of Dresden. After the war Billy makes a great deal of money as an optometrist, and on his wedding night he is kidnapped by a flying saucer from the planet Tralfamadore. So begins a modern classic by a master storyteller.</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classic <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> introduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. In a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and Vonnegut's) shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden. <p> Don't let the ease of reading fool you--Vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. He writes, "There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters..." <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> (taken from the name of the building where the POWs were held) is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is as important as any written since 1945. Like <i>Catch- 22</i>, it fashions the author's experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> boasts the same imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy--and humor.</p><i>Slaughterhous-Five</i> is one of the world's great anti-war books. Centering on the infamous fire-bombing of Dresden, Billy Pilgrim's odyssey through time reflects the mythic journey of our own fractured lives as we search for meaning in what we are afraid to know.</p><h2>The Manga Guide to Databases</h2><p>Want to learn about databases without the tedium?

We follow along as they design a relational database, understand the entity-relationship model, perform basic database operations, and delve into more advanced topics. Once the Princess is familiar with transactions and basic SQL statements, she can keep her data timely and accurate for the entire kingdom. Finally, Tico explains ways to make the database more efficient and secure, and they discuss methods for concurrency and replication.<br><br>Examples and exercises (with answer keys) help you learn, and an appendix of frequently used SQL statements gives the tools you need to create and maintain full-featured databases.<br><br>(Of course, it wouldn't be a royal kingdom without some drama, so read on to find out who gets the girl&#x2014;the arrogant prince or the humble servant.)<br><br>This EduManga book is a translation of a bestselling series in Japan, co-published with Ohmsha, Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan.</p><p><b>Mana Takahashi</b> is a graduate of the Tokyo University, Faculty of Economics.

General Ishii Shiro during World War II released hundreds of millions of infected insects across China, ultimately causing more deaths than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. These are just two of many startling examples found in <em>Six-legged Soldiers</em>, a brilliant portrait of the many weirdly creative, truly frightening, and ultimately powerful ways in which insects have been used as weapons of war, terror, and torture. <br> Beginning in prehistoric times and building toward a near and disturbing future, the reader is taken on a journey of innovation and depravity. Award-winning science writer Jeffrey A. Lockwood begins with the development of "bee bombs" in the ancient world and explores the role of insect-borne disease in changing the course of major battles, ranging from Napoleon's military campaigns to the trenches of World War I. He explores the horrific programs of insect warfare during World War II: airplanes dropping plague-infested fleas, facilities rearing tens of millions of hungry beetles to destroy crops, and prison camps staffed by doctors testing disease-carrying lice on inmates. The Cold War saw secret government operations involving the mass release of specially developed strains of mosquitoes on an unsuspecting American public--along with the alleged use of disease-carrying and crop-eating pests against North Korea and Cuba. Lockwood reveals how easy it would be to use of insects in warfare and terrorism today: In 1989, domestic ecoterrorists extorted government officials and wreaked economic and political havoc by threatening to release the notorious Medfly into California's crops.<br> A remarkable story of human ingenuity--and brutality--<em>Six-Legged Soldiers</em> is the first comprehensive look at the use of insects as weapons of war, from ancient times to the present day.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeffrey A. Lockwood</strong> is Professor of Natural Sciences &amp; Humanities at the University of Wyoming, where he teaches in the department of philosophy and in the MFA program in creative writing. An accomplished writer, his work has been included in the popular anthology <em>Best American Science and Nature</em> <em>Writing</em>, and he is winner of both a Pushcart Prize and the John Burroughs Award. He is the author of <em>Grasshopper Dreaming: Reflections on Killing and Loving</em> and <em>Locust: The Devastating Rise and Mysterious Disappearance of the Insect that Shaped the American Frontier</em>.<br>Few people think of flies, scorpions or potato bugs as weapons of war, but entomologist Lockwood (<i>Grasshopper Dreaming</i>), winner of a Pushcart Prize and a James Burroughs Award, details in this fascinating study how creepy crawlies have been used against the enemy since antiquity. The Romans' siege of a desert fortress ended abruptly when buckets of scorpions were dumped on their heads. Many a medieval army catapulted beehives or hornets' nests over a castle's ramparts to drive out the defenders. The Vietcong used a version of this trick, setting off small explosives near huge beehives when American soldiers walked by. Lockwood tells how the Japanese used Chinese civilians as human guinea pigs in their program to weaponize plague and other diseases. And Lockwood explores charges by the North Koreans and Fidel Castro that America has called out insect troops on occasion as well. Fortunately, as the author points out, insects aren't very cooperative soldiers, and using them to deliver diseases is much easier said than done. Both science and military history buffs will learn much from Lockwood, a self-described skeptic with a sense of humor. 49 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This announcement has rekindled interest in the claim made by Joseph Stalin, maintained to the end of his life, that Hitler got away. The truth is that no one saw Hitler and Eva Braun die in the bunker in Berlin on April 30, 1945. No photographs were taken to document claims Hitler and Evan Braun committed suicide. Hitler&#x2019;s body was never recovered. No definitive physical evidence exists proving Hitler died in the bunker in Berlin.<br><br>Dr. Jerome Corsi explores the historical possibility that Hitler escaped Nazi Germany at the end of World War II. FBI and CIA records maintained at the National Archives indicate that the US government took seriously reports at the end of World War II that Hitler had escaped to Argentina. More recent evidence suggests Hitler may have fled to Indonesia, where he married and worked at a hospital in Sumbawa. Even the chief of the US trial counsel at Nuremburg, Thomas J. Dodd, was quoted as saying, No one for sure can say Adolf Hitler is dead.&#x201d;<br><br>Putting massive amounts of evidence and research under a critical eye, Dr. Corsi shows that perhaps modern history&#x2019;s most tantalizing question has yet to be definitively answered: Did Hitler escaped Nazi Germany at the end of World War II to plot revenge and to plan the rise of the Fourth Reich?<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

Phaedrus (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p> Plato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought.</p><p> </p><p> In <i>Laches, Charmides,</i> and <i>Lysis,</i> Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. <i>Protagoras, Ion,</i> and <i>Meno</i> discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In <i>Gorgias,</i> Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The <i>Apology</i> (not a dialogue), <i>Crito, Euthyphro,</i> and the unforgettable <i>Phaedo</i> relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous <i>Symposium</i> and <i>Phaedrus,</i> written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. <i>Cratylus</i> discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the <i>Republic,</i> concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues <i>Euthydemus</i> deals with philosophy; metaphysical <i>Parmenides</i> is about general concepts and absolute being; <i>Theaetetus</i> reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, <i>Sophist</i> deals with not-being; <i>Politicus</i> with good and bad statesmanship and governments; <i>Philebus</i> with what is good. The <i>Timaeus</i> seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished <i>Critias</i> treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of <i>Laws</i> (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.</p><p> </p><p> The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.</p></p><p>Chris Emlyn-Jones is Emeritus Professor of Classical Studies, The Open University (UK).<br><br>William Preddy is Retired Head of Classics, Oakham School, Rutland (UK).</p><h2>God Dreams: 12 Vision Templates for Finding and Focusing Your Church&#39;s Future</h2><p><i>Is your team excited about the next big dream for your church?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> You are a visionary leader and your church probably has a vision statement. Yet most churches are stuck in a trap of generic communication without a truly visionary plan. Just like a visionary restaurant needs a more specific focus than &#x201c;serving food,&#x201d; a visionary church needs something more than biblical generalizations like &#x201c;loving God, loving people&#x201d; or &#x201c;making disciples and serving the world.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When a team doesn&#x2019;t share an understanding of God&#x2019;s next big dream, leadership grows tired, overworked by an &#x201c;all things to all people&#x201d; ministry approach.

These vision starters will dramatically accelerate your team's ability to find complete agreement regarding your church's future.<br> &nbsp;<br> Second, <i>God Dreams</i> explains how to overcome the fruitless planning efforts that many church teams experience. &nbsp;With a tool called the Horizon Storyline, leaders can connect short-term action steps with the long-range dream, while leveraging the power of storytelling to make the plan &#x201c;stick.&#x201d; &nbsp;This tool will galvanize a diverse team of ministry leaders and volunteers with unprecedented enthusiasm. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine leading with a refreshed sense of freedom and confidence, with a totally new way to inspire your church.

These fundamental conceptions were already in place in antiquity. The peculiar combination of ethnicity, nationality, and religion that would characterize Jewishness through the centuries first took shape in the second century B.C.E. This brilliantly argued, accessible book unravels one of the most complex issues of late antiquity by showing how these elements were understood and applied in the construction of Jewish identity&#x2015;by Jews, by gentiles, and by the state.<br><br>Beginning with the intriguing case of Herod the Great's Jewishness, Cohen moves on to discuss what made or did not make Jewish identity during the period, the question of conversion, the prohibition of intermarriage, matrilineal descent, and the place of the convert in the Jewish and non-Jewish worlds. His superb study is unique in that it draws on a wide range of sources: Jewish literature written in Greek, classical sources, and rabbinic texts, both ancient and medieval. It also features a detailed discussion of many of the central rabbinic texts dealing with conversion to Judaism.</p><p><b>Shaye J. D.

His earlier books include <i>Josephus in Galilee and Rome: His Vita and Development as a Historian</i> (1979) and <i>From the Maccabees to the Mishnah: A Profile of Judaism</i> (1987).&#34;One of the greatest strengths of Cohen&#39;s erudite book is that he is willing to acknowledge that many parts of his argument are open to challenge. While some might be overwhelmed by the sheer volume, this reviewer thinks he has done a great service in collecting an immense amount of relevant data, allowing readers to weigh the evidence for themselves and draw their own conclusions. . . . Cohen&#39;s book is the most comprehensive study to date on the question of Jewish identity in antiquity.&#34;--J. S.

Counterfeit Money (Carpenter Lectures)</h2><p>Is <i>giving</i> possible? Is it possible to give without immediately entering into a circle of exchange that turns the gift into a debt to be returned? This question leads Jacques Derrida to make out an irresolvable paradox at what seems the most fundamental level of the gift's meaning: for the gift to be received as a gift, it must not appear as such, since its mere appearance as gift puts it in the cycle of repayment and debt.<br><br>Derrida reads the relation of time to gift through a number of texts: Heidegger's <i>Time and Being,</i> Mauss's <i>The Gift,</i> as well as essays by Benveniste and Levi-Strauss that assume Mauss's legacy. It is, however, a short tale by Baudelaire, "Counterfeit Money," that guides Derrida's analyses throughout. At stake in his reading of the tale, to which the second half of this book is devoted, are the conditions of gift and forgiveness as essentially bound up with the movement of dissemination, a concept that Derrida has been working out for many years.<br><br>For both readers of Baudelaire and students of literary theory, this work will prove indispensable.</p><p>Is giving possible? Insofar as it enters into the circle of exchange (gift and countergift, debt, acquittal, compensation, symbolic recognition, memory), the gift seems to get annulled.

In its Old World origins, it served many purposes: as vegetable patch, cutting garden, and a place to sit in the cool of the evening. "It has evolved through common sense, combines need with enjoyment and is entirely unpretentious." <i>The Cottage Garden</i>, by Lloyd and photographer Richard Bird, is an homage to this centuries-old style that allows a multitude of plants to flourish in a small space, with a minimum, if crucial, amount of control exerted by the gardener. <p> Lloyd's introduction is a brisk examination of the cottage garden tradition, after which he describes a large number of cottage garden plants. Happily for North American gardeners, these include plants that are commonly found outside of Great Britain as well as those that have been in the English cottage garden for centuries. A chapter on cottage garden features addresses hedges, waterways and ponds, garden furnishings, and outbuildings. The book's final two chapters are "Planning the Cottage Garden," with several different layouts emphasizing different types of plants, and "The Working Cottage Garden," which offers details for tending the garden through the seasons and using its produce. Some of these seem rather deliberately quaint, such as the recipes for parsnip wine, mead, and pickled eggs. But overall, Richard Bird's serenely intimate photography and Lloyd's affable, opinionated erudition make <i>The Cottage Garden</i> a book to linger over. It's a pleasant addition to the lush DK Living series, which includes other notable gardening titles, such as Anna Pavord's <i>The New Kitchen Garden</i> and Pippa Greenwood's <i>The New Gardener</i>. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p></p><h2>Robinson Crusoe (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p>Daniel Defoe&#39;s great masterpiece, in a gorgeous new clothbound edition designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith. These delectable and collectible Penguin editions are bound in high-quality colourful, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design &#39;I walk&#39;d about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance ... reflecting upon all my comrades that were drown&#39;d, and that there should not be one soul sav&#39;d but my self ... &#39; Who has not dreamed of life on an exotic isle, far away from civilization? Here is the novel which has inspired countless imitations by lesser writers, none of which equal the power and originality of Defoe&#39;s famous book. Robinson Crusoe, set ashore on an island after a terrible storm at sea, is forced to make do with only a knife, some tobacco, and a pipe. He learns how to build a canoe, make bread, and endure endless solitude. That is, until, twenty-four years later, when he confronts another human being. First published in 1719, Robinson Crusoe has been praised by such writers as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Johnson as one of the greatest novels in the English language. &#39;Robinson Crusoe has a universal appeal, a story that goes right to the core of existence&#39; Simon Armitage</p><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p></p><h2>The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants</h2><p>Much as Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i> was a call to action against the pesticides that were devastating bird populations, Charles S. Elton's classic <i>The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants</i> sounded an early warning about an environmental catastrophe that has become all too familiar today&#x2014;the invasion of nonnative species. From kudzu to zebra mussels to Asian long-horned beetles, nonnative species are colonizing new habitats around the world at an alarming rate thanks to accidental and intentional human intervention. One of the leading causes of extinctions of native animals and plants, invasive species also wreak severe economic havoc, causing $79 billion worth of damage in the United States alone.<br><br>Elton explains the devastating effects that invasive species can have on local ecosystems in clear, concise language and with numerous examples.

In Alain Baraton's Versailles, every grove tells a story. As the gardener-in-chief, Baraton lives on its grounds, and since 1982 he has devoted his life to the gardens, orchards, and fields that were loved by France's kings and queens as much as the palace itself. His memoir captures the essence of the connection between gardeners and the earth they tend, no matter how humble or grand.<br><br>With the charm of a natural storyteller, Baraton weaves his own path as a gardener with the life of the Versailles grounds, and his role overseeing its team of eighty gardeners tending to 350,000 trees and thirty miles of walkways on 2,100 acres. He richly evokes this legendary place and the history it has witnessed but also its quieter side that he feels privileged to know. The same gardens that hosted the lavish lawn parties of Louis XIV and the momentous meeting between Marie Antoinette and the Cardinal de Rohan remain enchanted, private places where visitors try to get themselves locked in at night, lovers go looking for secluded hideaways, and elegant grandmothers secretly make cuttings to take back to their own gardens. A tremendous best seller in France, <i>The Gardener of Versailles</i> gives an unprecedentedly intimate view of one of the grandest places on earth.</p><p>Alain Baraton is the best-selling author of many books on gardening and the host of weekly gardening programs on French radio and television.&#x201c;Charming...Mr. Baraton is delightful when describing his daily routines&#x2014;he talks to his trees and has pet names for many of them&#x2014;and as a writer he is a master of what might be termed the inarguable Gallic utterance...but for a hands-on perspective and sheer fun, Mr. Baraton can't be beat.&#x201d; -<i>Wall Street Journal<br></i><br>"<b>What an eccentric and charming memoir</b>...

He is an engaging raconteur who tells his story with humility and a delightful sense of humor. He chooses his words to convey his passion and his personality. To read them is to have him in the room, where he entertains you without your having to reciprocate. In this case, though, that&#x2019;s cause for regret. I think he would be the sort of house guest one hates to see depart...Whether you enjoy reading of history or gardening or simply take pleasure in the memoir of someone who is passionate about his craft and finds gratification therein, I strongly recommend <i>The Gardener of Versailles: My Life in the World&#x2019;s Grandest Garden</i>. There is an undeniable sweetness to be found in being in sync with nature and in dancing to the rhythm of the seasons. Baraton tells us that, distilled to its essence, what makes a good gardener is joy. I have a feeling he is a very good gardener. He ranks high on a list of people I&#x2019;d like to meet &#x2013; ideally, on his turf<i>." -Paris Arts Travel<br><br></i>&#x201c;<b>An exquisite storyteller</b> who works in and lives among the gardens, Baraton immediately engages readers...Baraton has filled his book not only with interesting historical details and human stories of the royals who walked the grounds but with insightful, contemporary tales of wise coworkers and eccentric visitors.

Baraton also hosts gardening programs on French radio and television. If you have visited Versailles, this book will remind you of that gorgeous setting. If you have not, <b>it will inspire you</b> to do so with the help of Baraton's suggestions for a perfect tour." -<i>Chicago&nbsp;Botanic Garden<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Versailles head gardener and TV host Baraton reflects on his three decades tending some of the most beautiful gardens in the world: Simply but thoroughly, the author narrates the history of Versailles, from the days of Henry IV sneaking off to these woods to hunt to the days of the revolution. The author philosophizes about the ability of gardens to provide space for deep reflection, and he writes poetically about the beautiful power of the grounds he tends. He also provides some practical advice-e.g., the best places for a lovers' tryst. In addition to paying tribute to the work of these innovators, Baraton also looks at the various films that have been filmed on the grounds, storms that have battered them, and the effects of each season on the flora and fauna. The descriptions of the various sites on the grounds could only come from a man fortunate enough to have lived on and loved the site for almost 40 years." ~<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;In his capacious, generous memoir, Baraton beautifully renders the intersection of personal memories with French history and botanical splendors...The gardens of Versailles, however, are not entirely romanticized by Baraton. Darker moments, from the aftermath of a storm to suicides, balance the portrait of a place marked as much by seasonal change as by an irresistible mythology...This engaging account of decades spent cultivating pathways speaks volumes on public and private uses for gardens and of nature&#x2019;s enduring witness.&#x201d; -<i>Foreword Magazine<br><br></i>"A bestseller in France, this charming memoir offers an intimate account of life at one of the world&#x2019;s grandest gardens. Baraton came to Versailles in 1976 and has reigned over its grounds as jardiniï¿½re en chef since 1982; he willingly confesses his personal relationship with the trees there. A treat for horticulture buffs, this appealingly self-deprecating account weaves together Baraton&#x2019;s own story with that of the historic parterres and groves he so lovingly tends." <i>-France Magazine</i><br><br>"Whether you enjoy reading of history or gardening or simply take pleasure in the memoir of someone who is passionate about his craft and finds gratification therein, I strongly recommend<i> The Gardener of Versailles...." -BonJour Paris</i><br><br>"...a unique treasure....the real experiences and thoughts of someone who has worked (and lived!) on the grounds of Versailles add a personal touch that can't be achieved in a simple photobook or even general history of the palace and gardens.

Ranging from early colonial times to the present, <em>American Working-Class Literature</em> presents more than 300 literary texts that exemplify this tradition. It demonstrates how American working people live, labor, struggle, express themselves, and give meaning to their experiences both inside and outside of the workplace. The only book of its kind, this groundbreaking anthology includes work not only by the industrial proletariat but also by slaves and unskilled workers, by those who work unpaid at home, and by workers in contemporary service industries. As diverse in race, gender, culture, and region as America's working class itself, the selections represent a wide range of genres including fiction, poetry, drama, memoir, oratory, journalism, letters, oral history, and songs. Works by little-known or anonymous authors are included alongside texts from such acclaimed writers as Frederick Douglass, Upton Sinclair, Tillie Olsen, Philip Levine, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Leslie Marmon Silko. A rich selection of contemporary writing includes Martin Espada's poem "Alabanza" about the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.<br> <em>American Working-Class Literature</em> is organized chronologically into seven sections that highlight key historical and cultural developments in working-class life. The book is enhanced by an editors' introduction, section introductions, and individual head notes for each selection that provide biographical and historical context. A timeline of working-class history, rich illustrations, sidebars, reading lists, and a bibliography of critical commentary are also included.

Rather than simply list method after method, these nationally known and respected authors provide a specific repertoire of carefully sequenced, highly prescriptive procedures for teaching decoding, comprehension, content reading, and study skills. For each skill to be taught, they recommend strategies, discuss optimal timing, offer examples, and explain how to correct errors. In addition, they thoughtfully examine the relationships among different reading skills.</p></p><p></p><h2>ADVANCED PLACEMENT CALCULUS GRAPHICAL NUMERICAL ALGEBRAIC SIXTH EDITION HIGH SCHOOL BINDING COPYRIGHT 2020</h2><p><p>For APï¿½ Calculus AB and BC<br>This course is available on MyMathLab for School.<br>The sixth edition of <em>Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic, AP* Edition</em>, by Demana,<br>Waits, Kennedy, Bressoud, and Boardman completely supports the content, philosophy,<br>and goals of the Advanced Placement (AP*) Calculus courses (AB and BC).<br><br>The College Board recently finished a lengthy and thorough review of the AP* Calculus<br>courses to ensure that they were consistent with the best college and university courses<br>with similar educational goals. This review resulted in a repackaging of the course descriptions<br>in terms of big ideas, enduring understandings, learning objectives, and essential<br>knowledge, but the learning goals remained essentially the same. That allowed us to retain<br>the overall flow of our previous edition and concentrate our attention on how we might be<br>more helpful to you and your students in certain parts of the course.<br><br>A very broad look at the overall goals of this text is given in the following bulleted summary.<br>Although these are not explicit goals of the AP program and do not include all of the<br>learning objectives in the new AP Curriculum Framework, they do reflect the intentions of<br>the AP Calculus program. (Note that the goals preceded by an asterisk are aligned with the BC course and are not required in AB Calculus.)<br><br>ï¿½ Students will be able to work with functions represented graphically, numerically, analytically,<br>or verbally and will understand the connections among these representations;<br>graphing calculators will be used as a tool to facilitate such understanding.<br>ï¿½ Students will, in the process of solving problems, be able to use graphing calculators to<br>graph functions, solve equations, evaluate numerical derivatives, and evaluate numerical<br>integrals.<br>ï¿½ Students will understand the meaning of the derivative as a limit of a difference quotient<br>and will understand its connection to local linearity and instantaneous rates of change.<br>ï¿½ Students will understand the meaning of the definite integral as a limit of Riemann<br>sums and as a net accumulation of change over an interval, and they will understand and<br>appreciate the connection between derivatives and integrals.<br>ï¿½ Students will be able to model real-world behavior and solve a variety of problems<br>using functions, derivatives, and integrals; they will also be able to communicate solutions<br>effectively, using proper mathematical language and syntax.<br>ï¿½ Students will be able to represent and interpret differential equations geometrically with<br>slope fields and (*) numerically with Euler&#x2019;s method; they will be able to model dynamic<br>situations with differential equations and solve initial value problems analytically.<br>(*) Students will understand the convergence and divergence of infinite series and will<br>be able to represent functions with Maclaurin and Taylor series; they will be able to<br>approximate or bound truncation errors in various ways.<br>(*) Students will be able to extend some calculus results to the context of motion in the<br>plane (through vectors) and to the analysis of polar curves.<br><br>Changes to This Edition: <br> The big change in this new edition, of course, is that we welcome Michael Boardman to the author team. As a college mathematician with years of experience with the Advanced Placement (AP) program, he is well acquainted with the scope and goals of the course, and he is well versed in the mathematics that calculus students should know. Not only was Michael chief reader of the AP Calculus exams for four years, but he also served five years on the Development Committee and five years on the AP Calculus Workgroup for ETS. As perhaps his signal achievement, he founded the online discussion group for AP Calculus teachers and moderated it for a decade, so he truly understands what AP teachers<br>and students are looking for in these pages.<br><br>A Few Global Changes<br> As with previous editions, we have kept our focus on high school students taking one of the College Board&#x2019;s AP courses, Calculus AB or Calculus BC. The topics in the text reflect both the curriculum and the pedagogy of an AP course, and we do what we can to prepare students for the AP examinations throughout the text. To be consistent with the AP exam, we have changed all multiple-choice questions in the exercises to show four options rather than five. Also, as free-response questions on the AP examinations continue to evolve in focus and style, we have added or amended our exercises to reflect those changes. Although the role of graphing calculators in the course has not changed significantly since the fifth edition, we continue to review the gray &#x201c;no calculator&#x201d; ovals in the exercise sets to reflect an emerging consensus among calculus teachers that not every problem that can be solved without a calculator ought to be solved without a calculator.<br><br>We have further expanded the treatment of the derivative as a measure of sensitivity, which now appears as an ongoing topic in several different sections of the text. We have also enhanced our commitment to point-slope form for linear equations throughout the text, writing them all in a form that emphasizes the concept of local linearity, critical for understanding differential calculus.<br><br>Two new features have been added in response to the MPACs. There are now Notational Fluency Notes sprinkled throughout the text, and each set of Chapter Review Exercises begins with Reasoning with Definitions and Theorems questions that require students (individually or with their classmates) to dig more deeply into the concepts of calculus in order to understand them better.<br><br>Most of the motivational &#x201c;Chapter Opener&#x201d; problems are new and improved in this edition, and (thanks to David) many more historical nuggets have been sprinkled throughout the book. We also confess that some of the nuggets that were already there were in need of refinement. For example, the curious object called Gabriel&#x2019;s Horn in previous editions is now called Torricelli&#x2019;s Trumpet, with an accompanying historical note to give full credit where credit is due.<br><br>Finally, be assured that we have looked carefully at the content of the new AP Calculus Curriculum Framework, and there is nothing therein that is not covered in this text. Moreover, the emphases are in harmony with the objectives of the AP course, as they have always been.<br></p></p><p></p><h2>Maigret in New York (Inspector Maigret)</h2><p><b><b><b>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . .

After three decades of extensive research on those non-ordinary states of consciousness induced by psychedelic drugs and by other means, Grof concludes that our present scientific world view is as inadequate as many of its historical predecessors. In this pioneering work, he proposes a new model of the human psyche that takes account of his findings.<br><br>Grof includes in his model the recollective level, or the reliving of emotionally relevant memories, a level at which the Freudian framework can be useful. Beyond that is perinatal level in which the human unconscious may be activated to a reliving of biological birth and confrontation with death. How birth experience influences an individual's later development is a central focus of the book.<br><br>The most serious challenge to contemporary psycho-analytic theory comes from a delineation of the transpersonal level, or the expansion of consciousness beyond the boundaries of time and space.<br><br>Grof makes a bold argument that understanding of the perinatal and transpersonal levels changes much of how we view both mental illness and mental health.

A missionary is sent to a place so distant he finds his God has no power there; a husband abandons his wife as they honeymoon in the South American jungle; a splash of water triggers an explosion of violence; and a boy&#39;s drug-induced transformation leads to cruelty enjoyed and suffered. Masterfully written, these are chilling tales from sun-drenched and brutal climes.</p><p>Born in New York in 1910, Paul Bowles is considered one of the most remarkable American authors of the twentieth century. He studied music with composer Aaron Copland before moving to Tangier, Morocco, with his wife, Jane. His first novel, The Sheltering Sky, was a bestseller in the 1950s and was made into a film by Bernardo Bertolucci in 1990. Bowles&#39;s prolific career included many musical compositions, novels, collections of short stories, and books of travel, poetry, and translations. His other novels were The Spider&#39;s Nest, Up Above The World and Let It Come Down.</p><h2>Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel, Part 2</h2><p>Three Kingdoms tells the story of the fateful last reign of the Han dynasty (206 b.c.-a.d. 220), when the Chinese empire was divided into three warring kingdoms. This decisive period in Chinese history became a subject of intense and continuing interest to historians, poets, and dramatists. Writing some 1,200 years later, the Ming author Luo Guanzhong drew on this rich literary heritage to fashion a sophisticated, compelling narrative that has become the Chinese national epic. Luo&#39;s novel offers a startling and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought; it has influenced the ways the Chinese think about power, diplomacy, and war even to this day. As important for Chinese culture as the Homeric epics have been for the West, this Ming dynasty masterpiece continues to be widely influential in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, and remains a great work of world literature. The University of California Press is pleased to make the complete and unabridged translation available again.</p><p>"<i>The Three Kingdoms</i> gives us <i>The Iliad</i> of China.

Whatever the wider interest and significance of the book, the author is content to keep it entirely fiction and resists all temptation to press Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone into the story.

Le Goff argues that the doctrine of Purgatory did not appear in the Latin theology of the West before the late twelfth century, that the word <i>purgatorium</i> did not exist until then. He shows that the growth of a belief in an intermediate place between Heaven and Hell was closely bound up with profound changes in the social and intellectual reality of the Middle Ages. Throughout, Le Goff makes use of a wealth of archival material, much of which he has translated for the first time, inviting readers to examine evidence from the writings of great, obscure, or anonymous theologians.<br></p></p><p><b>Jacques Le Goff</b>&nbsp;(1927-2014) was a prominent French historian and&nbsp;medievalist.

More than sixty whites and thirty slaves died in the violence that followed. Among the most important slave revolts in colonial America, the Stono Rebellion also ranks as South Carolina's largest slave insurrection and one of the bloodiest uprisings in American history. Significant for the fear it cast among lowcountry slaveholders and for the repressive slave laws enacted in its wake, Stono continues to attract scholarly attention as a historical event worthy of study and reinterpretation.<br><br>Edited by Mark M. Smith, <i>Stono: Documenting and Interpreting a Southern Slave Revolt</i> introduces readers to the documents needed to understand both the revolt and the ongoing discussion among scholars about the legacy of the insurrection. Smith has assembled a compendium of materials necessary for an informed examination of the revolt. Primary documents-including some works previously unpublished and largely unknown even to specialists-offer accounts of the violence, discussions of Stono's impact on white sensibilities, and public records relating incidents of the uprising. To these primary sources Smith adds three divergent interpretations that expand on Peter H. Wood's pioneering study <i>Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion</i>. Excerpts from works by John K. Thornton, Edward A. Pearson, and Smith himself reveal how historians have used some of the same documents to construct radically different interpretations of the revolt's causes, meaning, and effects.</p><p>"This enormously valuable collection of original documents, together with Mark Smith's incisive commentary, offers a timely and most welcome reappraisal of the origins and ramifications of the Stono Rebellion. This is a powerful, eloquent, and moving account of the most significant slave rebellion in Britain's mainland American colonies. It is a brilliant study, and one that will be required reading for students of the peoples of the colonial South Carolina lowcountry for many years to come."ï¿½&#x20ac;"Betty Wood, Reader in American History, University of Cambridge <p>"We have come to expect much of Mark Smith, and he certainly does not disappoint in this brilliant collection of rare primary sources and essays by historians ranging from the classic to the cutting edge.

Max Edelson, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign </p><p>"This volume combines contemporary records of the Stono rebellion with essays by four leading scholars of the subject.

The wall paintings of ancient Egypt and Babylon are tempera, as are many of the paintings of Giotto, Lippi, Botticelli, Raphael, Titian, Tintoretto, and many other masters. But in spite of the time-proven excellence of this technique &#x2014; which boasts many clear advantages over oil paint &#x2014; it does not receive the degree of attention from modern painters that it deserves.<br>Part of the explanation for this neglect, surely, is the absence of sufficient information about the materials and procedures involved in tempera painting. The present volume, in fact, is virtually the only complete, authoritative, step-by-step treatment of the subject in the English language, D.V. Thompson wrote this book after an exhaustive study, over many years, of countless medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in the British Museum and elsewhere, and is unquestionably the world's leading authority on tempera materials and processes.<br>Beginning with an introductory chapter on the uses and limitations of tempera, the author covers such topics as the choice of material for the panel; propensities of various woods; preparing the panel for gilding; making the gesso mixture; methods of applying the gesso; planning the design of a tempera painting; use of tinted papers; application of metals to the panel; tools for gliding; handling and laying gold; combination gold and silver leafing; pigments and brushes; choice of palette; mixing the tempera; tempering and handling the colors; techniques of the actual painting; mordant gilding; permanence of tempera painting; varnishing; and artificial emulsion painting. The drawings and diagrams, illustrating the various materials and techniques, infinitely increase the clarity of the discussions. <br>As a careful exposition of all aspects of authentic tempera painting, including many of the possible modern uses for this ancient method, this book actually stands alone. No one who is interested in tempera painting as a serious pursuit can afford to be without it. </p></p><p></p><h2>Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Canto)</h2><p>People of European descent form the bulk of the population in most of the temperate zones of the world - North America, Australia and New Zealand.

He lives in New Haven CT. The Society of Biblical Literature is a 5,500 member international group of experts on the Bible and related fields.With The New Oxford Annotated Bible ( New Revised Standard Version ) only four years old, the need for another annotated NRSV isn't readily apparent. Still, when the publisher of the Harper's Bible Commentary and the Harper's Bible Dictionary publishes its own edition of the NRSV, it merits the attention of any serious bible student. An impressive array of biblical scholars has assembled a completely new set of introductions to each testament and to each biblical book, a fresh set of annotations to the text, and a modified set of textual apparatus. The book has many strengths. Most helpful are the annotations, which serve to identify chronology and location and explain wordplay. Many of the comments themselves are both up-to-date (comparing Simon's nickname, "Peter," to "Rocky" in Matthew 16.18) and felicitous (noting the similarity between the story of Moses' midwives, Exodus 1.8-22, and fairy tales like "Snow White"). The annotations particularly do a good job of revealing the interplay between biblical books and actually begin to explicate the text of Revelation. Yet the volume's comprehensiveness can also be its weakness. Notes on the gospels refer to noncanonical works that the average reader will not know and is not likely to have ready access to. Notes on authorial patterns such as symmetry and acrostic poetry don't sufficiently explain the impact of form upon content. In light of the reach this edition attempts, these drawbacks cannot be ignored. Ultimately, the breadth and depth of this study Bible, matched with its superior scholarship, make it a volume worth having in any collection. However, it is close enough in most respects to the Oxford Annotated edition that, if funds are limited and your library already possesses that edition, the HarperCollins edition would not be a necessary purchase.<br><i>- W.

Removing this gap between knowing and implementing has been the goal of Gilligan&#x2019;s work throughout his career.

In early infancy, the first task is to help your baby learn to sleep longer at night and stay awake for increasingly longer periods during the daytime. A few months on, separation anxiety makes its first appearance. During this phase, which may come and go for at least a year and possibly much longer, parents have to persuade their child over and over again that they're around to protect him, that it's safe to go to sleep, that "Good night" doesn't mean "Good-bye forever!" <br><br>Other issues crop up throughout childhood. Each one is different, just as each child is unique. And yet the problems fall into predictable patterns, such as bedtime resistance, nighttime fears that keep a child sleepless, the midnight rambler who roams the house, the child who insists she can only sleep in her parents' bed. As each new problem arises, parents not only implore, "How can we get our child to sleep?" but also wonder, "When will we ever get a night's sleep?"<br><br>While sleep disturbances are common in childhood, they shouldn't be ignored. One study of 3-year-olds receiving treatment for sleep problems found that 84 percent of the children had had their problems since infancy. Another study showed that college students with sleep troubles had had familiar difficulties since early childhood. <br><br>Unlike some minor behavioral issues, sleep problems usually don't just go away if you ignore them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubles with sleep can dog youngsters throughout the school years, causing difficulties with learning and behavior. The good news is that no matter what your family's specific problem may be, it's never too late to take steps to correct it. <br><br>Some sleep problems reflect normal stages in children's emotional and behavioral development. Provided a satisfactory routine was established early on, calm, loving reassurance may be enough to help get your child back into a habit of settling down to sleep. <br><br>Other problems stem from habits that may have been unintentionally fostered by parents or caregivers. In such cases, well-meaning efforts to help the child sleep have backfired, resulting in a child who resists going to bed, can't get to sleep on his own, has to be rocked to sleep, needs a bottle at night, wakes often during the night, or wakes up too early in the morning and looks for company. <br><br>In this book, a Guide to Your Child's Sleep, the members of the American Academy of Pediatrics share suggestions that have helped many of the families in their care. Pediatricians recognize that there is not always an easy answer to a sleep problem, and what works for one family may not necessarily be the answer for others. <br><br>Parents should feel free to adapt the Academy's recommendations according to the different temperaments and personalities of their children and themselves, as well as the many other factors that influence family dynamics. In this, as in other aspects of bringing up your child, trust your instincts and listen to your child. You know your own child better than anyone. Finding a solution that suits your family's style will make everybody happy and ensure restful nights. <br><br>In preparing a Guide to Your Child's Sleep, Academy members received invaluable help from parents, caregivers, and children who responded to our sleep survey website. The same themes recurred again and again: <br><br>"How do I get my baby to sleep in her own bed?" <br><br>"When will my toddler stop waking up several times a night?" <br><br>"Why does my child wake up too early every morning?" <br><br>"What's the best way to deal with persistent bed-wetting?" <br><br>"Where do nighttime fears come from?" <br><br>"My child's schedule is all mixed up; how do I get him to sleep at night and stay awake for school?" <br><br>Other frequently asked questions probed the pros and cons of the family bed for young families, sleep changes in the teenage years, and how much sleep is needed for rest and repair at the various stages of childhood. <br><br>We have included many of these questions, together with our contributors' recommendations, as framed boxes alongside the text. Not every question could be reprinted, due to the large numbers received, but we selected at least one from each category to ensure that problems were addressed from as broad a viewpoint as possible. <br><br>In this book we recommend strategies for establishing lifelong habits of restful sleep. These suggestions reflect our experience not only as pediatricians, but also as parents who have survived many sleepless nights and groggy days. Our suggestions take account of parents' need for sleep, which is too often overlooked. Sleep-deprived parents and crotchety babies don't make a happy combination. <br><br>This book deals extensively with the early childhood years, because that's when problems are most common and when parents feel most in need of sleep. However, sleep troubles in the school years and in adolescence are also covered. Here and there, we have repeated information as it applies to the different ages and stages of childhood. This repetition together with a detailed index and extensive cross-referencing will, we hope, make it easier for parents to refer to the book as new issues arise. <br><br>The information in this guide has been reviewed by many experts and represents the consensus of the 55,000 pediatricians who are members of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Members include pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and pediatric surgical specialists. <br><br>Not only are they physicians concerned with the health and well-being of children and young people, but the overwhelming majority are also parents who have to deal with the same childhood issues-in colicky infants, wakeful toddlers, resistant school-age youngsters, and sleepy adolescents-that every parent and caregiver must handle. The advice in this guide comes, therefore, from their experiences both as trained medical specialists and as sometimes exhausted, occasionally perplexed, and always loving and fulfilled parents. <br><br>Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee<br>All through the night.<br><br>George J.

But by itself, DNA is just an inert blueprint for life. It is the ribosome--an enormous molecular machine made up of a million atoms--that makes DNA come to life, turning our genetic code into proteins and therefore into us. <i>Gene Machine</i> is an insider account of the race for the structure of the ribosome, a fundamental discovery that both advances our knowledge of all life and could lead to the development of better antibiotics against life-threatening diseases. But this is also a human story of Ramakrishnan's unlikely journey, from his first fumbling experiments in a biology lab to being the dark horse in a fierce competition with some of the world's best scientists. In the end, <i>Gene Machine</i> is a frank insider's account of the pursuit of high-stakes science.<br><br></p><p><b>Venki Ramakrishnan</b> shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for uncovering the structure of the ribosome. He is a senior scientist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, and also the president of the Royal Society in London."It is [Ramakrishnan's] full embrace of the role of the antihero that makes <i>Gene Machine</i> so much fun to read and also serves as a reminder to us all of the beating human heart that lies at the center of every advance in science."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Wall Street Journal </i></b></i></b><br><br>"An engaging and witty memoir... This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility...

It's all here: the ambition, jealousy and factionalism--as well as the heroic late nights, crippling anxiety and disastrous mistakes--that underlie the apparently serene and objective surface represented by the published record."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Nature </i></b></i></b><br><br><b><i>Choice </i>award for outstanding academic titles</b><br><br>"An enchanting and invigorating work, <i>Gene Machine</i> casts a many-angled light on the world of science, the nature of discovery, and on one of the deepest mysteries of twentieth-century biology. Ramakrishnan, one of the key players in deciphering the molecular basis of protein translation, gives us both a rollicking scientific story and a profoundly human tale. In the tradition of <i>The Double Helix</i>, <i>Gene Machine</i> does not hesitate to highlight the process by which science advances: moving through fits and starts, often underscored by deep rivalries and contests, occasionally pitching towards error and misconception, but ultimately advancing towards profound and powerful truths. An outsider to the world of ribosome biology--an Indian immigrant, a physicist by training--Ramakrishnan retains his 'outsider's' vision throughout the text, reminding us about the corrosive nature of scientific prizes, and the intensity of competition that drives researchers (both ideas, I suspect, will have a munificent effect on our current scientific culture). <b>Ramakrishnan's writing is so honest, lucid and engaging that I could not put this book down until I had read to the very end</b>."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Siddhartha Mukherjee</b></i></b><br><br>"If someone had told me that one of the most witty and enthralling books I'd read this year would be on the quest to understand ribosomes, I believe I would have laughed in his face, but I would have been quite wrong. <i>Gene Machine</i> is beyond superb." &#x2015;<b><i><b>Bill Bryson</b></i></b><br><br>"The ribosome, a structure of astonishing complexity, 'lies at the crossroads of life' and Venki Ramakrishnan played a key role in revealing its biological mysteries. His superb account lays out the science with great lucidity, but he also grants us the human face of science--the hard work and brilliant insights, of course, but also the role of luck, of personalities, jealousy, money, the roulette of major awards, and the further rewards heaped upon the fortunate. Science, in his glorious telling, becomes 'a play, with good and bad characters.' Competition and collaboration can appear inseparable, crucial figures get overlooked. It's a wonderful book and a great corrective to the notion of science as dispassionate, untainted objectivity."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ian McEwan</b></i></b><br><br>"The ribosome is the central processor that decodes the universal machine-code of life, and the history of its unravelling is on a par with that of DNA itself. You could think of Venki Ramakrishnan as a sort of 'nice Jim Watson.' His meticulously detailed and generous memoir has the same disarming frankness as <i>The Double Helix</i>.

In this way, the book helps readers to explore each of the major religions as a unique and integral system of meaning and life. At the same time, readers are encouraged to discover and explore the nature of religious experience by comparing basic themes and issues common to all religions. <b> </b> Covering the religions arising from India, China, Japan, and the Mediterranean world, this book introduces the key dimensions of religious experience, outlining the basic human concerns that give rise to religious experience, such as origin and identity, ultimate reality, human nature, and the good life. <b> </b> For anyone interested in exploring the origins and development of the diverse religions of the world.<br> </p></p><p>By combining a historical-descriptive presentation of individual religions with a comparative-thematic approach, this text accomplishes two important goals. First, it allows students to examine each of the world&#39;s major religions as a unique system of meaning. At the same time, it lets them to explore the inner nature of sacred experience by comparing basic themes and issues common to all religions and pertinent to their own personal lives. An introductory chapter discusses the basic human questions and concerns behind religion, such as origin and identity, ultimate reality, human nature, and the good life. These essential concepts are then used to help describe the beliefs, practices, and historical development of each religion. This new edition has been streamlined in several key areas, while including more material on sacred art and the role of women in religion. As the work of a single scholar--much of it based on original research--this book offers a consistency and depth missing in many of the texts in this field.Preface to the Third Edition <p> For people who are just beginning their study of the world's religions, the sheer immensity of the dataï¿½names, vocabulary, historical developments, teachings and practicesï¿½can be very daunting. Yet it is important that this encounter result not in perplexity and a sense of being overwhelmed, but in an awakening of interest and a desire to continue to explore and understand. </p> <p> With such readers in mind, the basic approach in this volume is focused on the goal of understanding. And understanding begins with a sense of what a particular religion means for the people who practice it and live by it. It is important to realize that each religious tradition is a living and growing organism stretched out over time, and thus we pay attention to historical and cultural developments. But we also attempt to go beyond historical information and let readers find themselves in the place of the people who live by each religionï¿½viewing the world through their sacred stories, their worldview, their rituals, and their notion of the good life. </p> <p> The procedure used in this volume, then, combines the necessary discussion of historical matters with a thematic approach based on general issues that arise out of human experienceï¿½questions about personal identity, human existence and wholeness, and the right way to live. Since the reader can identify with such issues from personal experience, windows are opened toward an understanding of the meaning and guidance people find in their particular religious traditions. Further, this combination of historical and thematic approaches facilitates comparison among the religious traditions, highlighting the main motifs and concerns of that general dimension of human life we call religious experience. </p> <p> Since this is a basic introduction for people who are beginning their exploration of the world's religious paths, the major focus is not on academic questions and theories about religion, nor on technical information about all the movements and historical developments that make up each religious tradition. Such theories and developments are important, of course, and this volume attempts to make readers aware of them in a beginning way. It is important that readers get the sense that each religious tradition is a highly complex living organism, with various movements arising at different points in history. Yet it is helpful for the beginning student of the world's religions to recognize first of all the general mainstream of each religious tradition in constructing an overall picture of the religious world of humankind. The excitement and challenge of this venture will carry over, it is hoped, into a continuing engagement with understanding the complex religious traditions of the world and with the various issues raised in the academic study of these traditions. </p> <p> This third edition of The Sacred Paths has been revised throughout to bring material up to date and to provide the reader with greater clarity in the discussions of complex historical and theoretical materials. The general structure of the book has been retained, focused on major groupings or families of religions. But the structure now more clearly follows a geographical taxonomy, with the major sections devoted to religions arising in India, religions of China and Japan, and religions arising in the Mediterranean world. Within these geographical groupings, family resemblances between the religious traditions can be elaborated and discussed. This structure makes it possible, for example, to study the families of Abrahamï¿½Judaism, Christianity, and Islamï¿½in the context of the ancient traditions of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. To fill out this context, a new chapter on the important Zoroastrian tradition has been added. </p> <p> This edition retains and enhances the characteristic emphases from the previous editions. It is particularly important that readers have some encounter with the sacred texts and scriptures of each particular religious traditionï¿½yet the comprehension and appreciation of such sacred texts is notoriously difficult for an outsider. This volume incorporates extensive quotations from the sacred texts of each tradition, providing interpretation so the reader can see the significance of these texts and comprehend what they mean for people of that religious tradition. It will be helpful, of course, if this volume is supplemented with an additional collection of sacred texts, when that is feasible. </p> <p> The inclusion of material on artistic expression in the different religious traditions helps the reader see that each religion or culture has its own unique aesthetic sense. Thus it is important, for understanding each tradition, to pay attention to the special artistic expressions growing out of that religious experience. Also, this volume gives particular attention to the role of women in each tradition. Greater awareness of women's experiences and leadership roles has made possible many new understandings and insights in all the religious traditions. Further, an important development in the modern western world is the rise of new religious movements, and a special chapter is devoted to understanding some of these alternative movements. </p> <p> Among the study features in this volume, the discussion questions for each chapter have been revised and expanded. These questions are designed to promote review of the material as well as further reflection on the character of each religious tradition. Other study features include maps, timelines, and a glossary of key terms. The suggestions for further reading for each religious tradition have incorporated many important books that have been published in the last few years. </p> <p> Many have helped along the way in the development of this book and toward the completion of this third edition. And so I thank all those students and colleagues who have made so many helpful suggestions concerning ways in which this text can become a more helpful means for understanding the religious paths of the world. </p> <p> Thank you to the reviewers of this edition: K.R. Sundararajan, Saint Bonaventure University; Charles Orzech, University of North Carolina, Greenville; and Bruce M. Sullivan, Northern Arizona University.</p></p><h2>Day by Day: English for Employment Communication</h2><p><p>This comprehensive introduction to general workplace communication helps students learn the language they need to obtain employment and communicate effectively with supervisors, co-workers, and customers.<br> Also includes a <i>Word-by-Word/ Side-by-Side</i> correlation key. </p></p><p></p><h2>Picturing Frederick Douglass: An Illustrated Biography of the Nineteenth Century&#39;s Most Photographed American</h2><p><p><strong>Finalist for the Gilder Lehrman Lincoln Prize</strong></p><p><strong>A landmark and collectible volume&#x2015;beautifully produced in duotone&#x2015;that canonizes Frederick Douglass through historic photography.</strong></p> Commemorating the bicentennial of Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s birthday and featuring images discovered since its original publication in 2015, this &#x201c;tour de force&#x201d; (<em>Library Journal</em>, starred review) reintroduced Frederick Douglass to a twenty-first-century audience.

Love as feeling and mood is distinguished from works of love, love of the lovable from love of the unlovely, preferential love from love as the royal law, love as mutual egotism from triangular love, and erotic love from self-giving love.</p><br><p> This work is marked by Kierkegaard's Socratic awareness of the reader, both as the center of awakened understanding and as the initiator of action. Written to be read aloud, the book conveys a keenness of thought and an insightful, poetic imagination that make such an attentive approach richly rewarding. <i>Works of Love </i>not only serves as an excellent place to begin exploring the writings of Kierkegaard, but also rewards many rereadings.</p></p><p><b>Howard V.

Every day a new blaze seems to ignite: the bloody implosion of Iraq and Syria; the East-West standoff in Ukraine; abducted schoolgirls in northern Nigeria. Is there some thread tying these frightening international security crises together? In a riveting account that weaves history with fast-moving reportage and insider accounts from the Afghanistan war, Sarah Chayes identifies the unexpected link: corruption.</p><p>Since the late 1990s, corruption has reached such an extent that some governments resemble glorified criminal gangs, bent solely on their own enrichment. These kleptocrats drive indignant populations to extremes&#x2015;ranging from revolution to militant puritanical religion. Chayes plunges readers into some of the most venal environments on earth and examines what emerges: Afghans returning to the Taliban, Egyptians overthrowing the Mubarak government (but also redesigning Al-Qaeda), and Nigerians embracing both radical evangelical Christianity and the Islamist terror group Boko Haram. In many such places, rigid moral codes are put forth as an antidote to the collapse of public integrity.</p><p>The pattern, moreover, pervades history. Through deep archival research, Chayes reveals that canonical political thinkers such as John Locke and Machiavelli, as well as the great medieval Islamic statesman Nizam al-Mulk, all named corruption as a threat to the realm. In a thrilling argument connecting the Protestant Reformation to the Arab Spring, <em>Thieves of State</em> presents a powerful new way to understand global extremism. And it makes a compelling case that we must confront corruption, for it is a cause&#x2015;not a result&#x2015;of global instability.</p></p><p>Dear readers:<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks very much for visiting this page, and for your interest in <i>Thieves of State</i>.&nbsp; I wrote this book to address a dumbfounding impasse: the inability of senior U.S. officials to make the connection between acute and abusive corruption and dramatic global upheavals, from the rise of violent extremism to the revolutions of the Arab Spring or Ukraine.&nbsp; What <i>Thieves of State</i> does is take you with me, so you can experience for yourself not just the abuse and humiliation of everyday corruption in many countries, but also the inner workings of the U.S. government as it reached a decision not to address the problem.<br><br>We'll also take a fascinating historical detour, for history has much to teach us about how people have grappled with these issues - and about how similar their responses have been across time and culture.&nbsp; We'll detail hard-nosed options for different approaches, and we'll take a glance in the mirror.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is an unusual book: no dry, expository policy-wonk analysis, rather a riveting story that will keep you engaged.&nbsp; But you'll also find plenty of thought-provoking, even sometimes provocative, analysis.&nbsp; I hope that you like it, and that you will let me know your thoughts either way.An Excerpt From<br><i><b>THIEVES OF STATE</b></i><br>by Sarah Chayes<br>Reprinted here with permission.<br><br>The question of pursuing a serious anticorruption policy was finally put to rest in January 2011.&nbsp; The battle was waged in the margins of an interagency document called "Objective 2015."&nbsp; It had occurred to someone that the U.S. government really ought to have a picture of what it was trying to achieve in Afghanistan - what the country would need to look like by the end of 2014 if it were to weather the withdrawal of international troops without imploding.<br>&nbsp;<br>The document was an embarrassment.&nbsp; Just the grammatical errors in the first paragraph made me flinch.&nbsp; Rather than identify true minimal requirements for Afghanistan to survive without international troops, it cut down ambitions to fit what was deemed "achievable" - whether or not such goals were sufficient to ensure Afghanistan could continue to exist.<br>&nbsp;<br>It seemed to me, for example, that for the Afghan government to last, motivations for joining the insurgency had to diminish.&nbsp; Afghans had better think more highly of their government by 2015 than they did in 2011.&nbsp; Yet in the document, the very modest goal of an upward trend in Afghans' confidence in their government was not listed as essential to mission success.&nbsp; It was considered only a "nice-to-have."<br>&nbsp;<br>The real anticorruption fight, however, was not over such fundamentals.&nbsp; It played out in the fine print of the document's "implementation guidelines."&nbsp; Over the furious dissent of mid-level Justice Department (DoJ) officials, seconded by the Joint Staff - but not by their own chief, Attorney General Eric Holder - the documents barred DoJ attorneys from mentoring anticorruption cases.&nbsp; They could do generalized capacity building, but they could not help shepherd specific cases against specific Afghan government officials.&nbsp; The investigations units, even if they were able to continue functioning, would never be able to bring a case to court.&nbsp; The courageous anticorruption prosecutors could never hope for backup from U.S. officials if they were intimidated, harassed, or demoted.<br>&nbsp;<br>The gavel had come down.&nbsp; By way of an apparently insignificant detail buried deep in an interagency document - a few words of guidance to DoJ attorneys - the U.S. decision to turn a blind eye to Afghan corruption was finally spelled out.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>NOT TILL the spring of 2013 did the penny drop as to what had prompted Petraeus's sudden change of heart in the summer of 2010 - and ultimately, what made the U.S. government shrink from addressing corruption in Afghanistan.&nbsp; On April 28, Matthew Rosenberg of the New York Times reported that the CIA had been paying millions of dollars per year, in cash, to President Karzai.&nbsp; Toward the end of his article was the nugget of information that told the whole story.<br>&nbsp;<br>The CIA's bagman was Muhammad Zia Salehi - that aide to Karzai who had been arrested, and then quickly released, in the summer of 2010.&nbsp; U.S. officials had walked into a circular firing squad.&nbsp; Salehi, the subject of the U.S. government's corruption&nbsp; test case, was also the U.S. government's intermediary for cash payments to Karzai.&nbsp; The choice of this target may have been deliberate - an effort to flush out into the open the profound contradiction at the heart of U.S. policy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two senior U.S. officials told me later that throughout the investigation of Salehi, the planning for the arrest, and his liberation within a few hours, CIA personnel had remained silent about their relationship with him.&nbsp; Even afterward, despite strong words at Principals' Committee meetings and that Joint Staff "top twenty" list, the CIA never provided the U.S. ambassador or the key cabinet secretaries with the names of the Afghans it was paying.&nbsp; The station chief in Kabul continued to hold private meetings with Karzai, with no other U.S. officials present.<br>&nbsp;<br>In other words, a secret CIA agenda - which involved enabling the very summit of Afghanistan's kleptocracy - was in direct conflict with the anticorruption agenda.&nbsp; And with no one explicitly arbitrating this contradiction, the CIA's agenda won out.<br>&nbsp;<br>After those first few weeks in command, Petraeus veered hard away from governance efforts and devoted himself to targeted killing, which he intensified considerably.&nbsp; Targeted killing of individual terrorist suspects is the special domain of the CIA, which Petraeus left Kabul to run - until his tenure there was cut short by an extramarital affair that had germinated in the Yellow Building at ISAF headquarters.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Obama Administration, sickened by the cost in lives and resources that the counterinsurgency approach was exacting, and perhaps uncomfortable with the power and discretion that large-scale military operations place in the hands of the brass, turned increasingly toward special operations and drone warfare to counter security threats.&nbsp; Targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing, over which the president had direct control, increased after 2010, spreading to Yemen and other theaters.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the point officials missed in making this shift - and in letting the priorities generated by this strategy trump governance objectives - is that targeted killings still represent a military response to a problem that is fundamentally political and economic in nature: a problem that is rooted in the conduct of government.&nbsp; The current U.S. approach sends a message, wittingly or not, to people who are often driven to violence by the abusively corrupt practices of their ruling cliques, and by frustration at seeing their legitimate grievance systematically ignored.&nbsp; The message seems to be: your grievances are, in fact, of no account.&nbsp; They will not be heard.</p><h2>National Geographic Kids Everything Money: A wealth of facts, photos, and fun!</h2><p>All you need to know about money can be found in the pages of this colorful, energetic, and accessible book.

For National Geographic Kids, Kathy has written <i>Everything Weather </i>and <i>Everything Money</i>.This large-format book might not tell everything about money, as the title implies, but provides a great many facts related to the subject. Although each double-page spread offers a particular topic and browsers can jump back and forth without regard to page numbers, the information is loosely organized into four chapters: one on the concept and history of money; another on the making, spending, and saving of it; one called The Power of Money; and, finally, Fun with Money. The latter introduces money myths, the concept of exchange rates, and a project which involves turning a dollar bill into an origami butterfly. Often combining a number of small-print text boxes and illustrations on a page with several brightly colored backgrounds, the crowded layouts can be visually distracting. Even so, kids drawn to the excellent photos, dynamic presentation, and grab-bag approach to information may enjoy the book. Recommended as a supplement to more traditional presentations on money.

Funny, satiric, poignant, filled with allusions to earlier American writers, it is the &#x201c;confession&#x201d; of a middle-aged, sophisticated European ï¿½migrï¿½&#x2019;s passionate obsession with a twelve-year-old American &#x201c;nymphet,&#x201d; and the story of their wanderings across a late 1940s America of highways and motels. (Nabokov&#x2019;s film adaptation of&nbsp;<i>Lolita</i>, as originally written for director Stanley Kubrick, is also included.)<br><i><br>Pnin</i>&nbsp;(1957) is a comic masterpiece about a gentle, bald Russian ï¿½migrï¿½ professor in an American college town who is never quite able to master its language, its politics, or its train schedule. Nabokov&#x2019;s years as a teacher provided rich background for this satirical picture of academic life, with an unforgettable figure at its center: &#x201c;It was the world that was absent-minded and it was Pnin whose business it was to set it straight. His life was a constant war with insensate objects that fell apart, or attacked him, or refused to function, or viciously got themselves lost as soon as they entered the sphere of his existence.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Pale Fire</i>&nbsp;(1962) is a tour de force in the form of an ostensibly autobiographical poem by a recently deceased American poet and a critical commentary by an academic who is something other than what he seems.

But this deluxe volume is most valuable for its inclusion of <i>Lolita</i> alongside the screenplay that Nabokov wrote for Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's film is quite different from the version Nabokov intended, and <i>Novels 1955-1962</i> offers the opportunity to compare <i>Lolita</i>'s two Nabokovian incarnations with Kubrick's film and with the recent, very controversial movie directed by Adrian Lyne and starring Jeremy Irons.The Library of America is an award-winning, nonprofit program dedicated to publishing America&#39;s best and most significant writing in handsome, enduring volumes, featuring authoritative texts.

A Book Sense selection and a finalist for the Giller Prize, the Chapters/Books in Canada First Novel Award, and the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize, <i>Cereus Blooms at Night</i> is an exquisite cross-generational history filled with thrilling passion and alluring mystery. &nbsp;Set in the fictional Caribbean town of Paradise, <i>Cereus Blooms at Night</i> unveils the mystery surrounding Mala Ramchandin, an aging, notoriously crazy woman suspected of murdering her father. When a judge finds Mala unfit to stand trial, she is delivered, frail and mute, to the Paradise Alms House and into the care of Tyler, a vivacious male nurse, who becomes the unlikely storyteller of Mala&#x2019;s extraordinary life. In luminous, sensual prose, Mootoo explores identity, gender, and violence in a celebration of our capacity to love despite cruelty and despair.</p><p>There is much to admire about Shani Mootoo's first novel, <i>Cereus Blooms at Night</i>. In telling the tale of Mala Ramchandin, her sister, Asha, her childhood sweetheart Ambrose "Boyie" Mohanty, and the other inhabitants of the fictional Caribbean island of Lantanacamara, Mootoo has created a cast of remarkable characters capable of charming the reader. Narrated in part by Tyler, a young male nurse at a home for the elderly, <i>Cereus</i> begins with Mala's admission to the alms house in Paradise--the main city on Lantanacamara--under a cloud of mystery. The old lady won't speak and is suspected of a multitude of crimes, causing the head nurse of the home to keep her in restraints. Only Tyler is willing to care for her; it isn't long before Tyler, an outcast in Paradise because of his sexual orientation, and Mala, a pariah for other reasons, develop an unusual friendship.<p> For the first half of the book, Mootoo moves easily between Tyler's narrative and a third-person account of Mala's life as a child. The chapters covering the adoption of Mala's father, Chandin Ramchandin, by a white missionary and his wife and Chandin's obsession with his foster sister, Lavinia, offer a telling perspective on race and colonialism; later chapters detailing Chandin's descent into alcoholism, madness, and child abuse are occasionally overwrought, but the strong, child's-eye point of view of young Mala keeps the novel grounded. The second half of <i>Cereus</i> abandons both Tyler and the omniscient narrator, choosing to focus, instead, on Otoh Mohanty, the son of Mala's childhood friend, Boyie. Here Mootoo also introduces, for the first time, elements of the fantastic: a girl who "wills" herself to become a boy; a man who sleeps for weeks at a time, only waking one day each month; a mysterious, locked room that holds a horrifying secret. The result is pure melodrama wrapped up in lovely prose.</p><p> Even though the last half of the book seems too suddenly freighted towards the magical and improbable, and the happy ending is a trifle too contrived, <i>Cereus Blooms at Night</i> showcases Shani Mootoo's impressive mastery of language. And in Mala Ramchandin, she has created a tough and tender heroine who commands the reader's interest and sympathy from first page to last. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Shani Mootoo's haunting and evocative debut novel has taken the international literary world by storm.

It is often invokved to explain and justify the liberal politics and world view of modernity. And it leads to the view that "politicized religions" threaten both reason and liberty. Asad's essays explore and question all these assumptions. He argues that "religion" is a construction of European modernity, a construction that authorizes&#x2015;for Westerners and non-Westerners alike&#x2015;particular forms of "history making."</p></p><p><p><b>Talal Asad</b> is a professor of anthropology at the Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>"This eloquent, lucid, and complex work is the product of remarkable intelligence and erudition; it is a profound contribution to the understanding of the cultural hegemony of the West."</p> (Ralph M.

Taylor's classic <em>The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918</em>. Paul Schroeder's comprehensive and authoritative addition to the <em>Oxford History of Modern Europe</em> charts the course of international history over the turbulent era of 1763-1848 in which the map of Europe and much of the world was redrawn time and again. Schroeder examines the wars, political crises, and intricate diplomatic transactions of the age, many of which, especially the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and the Congress of Vienna and its aftermath, had far-reaching consequences for modern Europe.<br> Schroeder also provides a new sharply revisionist account of the course of international politics over these years and a major reinterpretation of the structure and operation of the international system. He shows how the practice of international politics was transformed in revolutionary ways with extensive and beneficial effects. The Vienna Settlement established peace, he demonstrates, by abandoning, not restoring, the competitive balance-of-power politics of the eighteenth century, and devising a new political equilibrium in its stead. A European consensus on a new political balance was developed, with new rules to maintain it, ushering in a uniquely peaceful, progressive period in European international politics. This wide-ranging and penetrating study will be of great interest to historians, political scientists, and students of international relations.<br></p><p>This is the only modern study of European international politics to cover the entire timespan from the end of the Seven Years&#39; War in 1763 to the revolutionary year of 1848. Besides offering a comprehensive and authoritative account of this era&#39;s many wars, crises, and diplomatic developments, it reveals its unifying theme; the collapse of the eighteenth-century international system in a generation of great systemic wars from 1787 to 1812, the painful construction of a new international system from 1813 to 1815, and the successful operation of that system, giving Europe its most peaceful, progressive era of international politics ever. In a major reinterpretation of the structure and operation of the international system Professor Schroeder rejects most of the standard explanations for the failure of the earlier coalitions against Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the success of the final one, and the durability of the Vienna Settlement. The secret of durable peace was not, he argues, military victory, the restoration of monarchical authority and a balance of power, and the fear of renewed revolution. It was instead the abandonment of competitive eighteenth-century balance-of-power politics in favour of a new political equilibrium, a balance of rights, security, and satisfactions, based upon a genuine, European-wide consensus on the meaning of peace and the kinds of rules and practices needed to sustain it. Thus the story of the transformation of European politics in this era offers insights and hope also for international politics today.Paul W.

Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret (LJ 2/1/75) was the first book to reveal how the Allies broke the main German code system in World War II. Many books, such as Ron Lewin's Ultra Goes To War (LJ 12/15/78), have since expanded upon the process and its impact on the war effort. Kahn, a noted historian of codebreaking, provides a specialized part of the story not previously detailed. He underscores the strategic importance of submarine warfare in the Atlantic, giving a balanced account of the ultimate importance of codebreaking in that arena. High drama at sea seizing German codebooks and equipment and analytical genius ashore were essential. Kahn describes both of these matching efforts expertly. Informed laypersons and specialists will find this book valuable and intriguing. Recommended.<br><i>- George H.

Set in Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s, The Call of the Wild is about Buck, the magnificent cross-bred offspring of a St Bernard and a Scottish Collie. Stolen from his pampered life on a Californian estate and shipped to the Klondike to work as a sledge dog, he triumphs over his circumstances and becomes the leader of a wolf pack. The story records the decivilisation of Buck as he answers the call of the wild , an inherent memory of primeval origins to which he instinctively responds. In contrast, White Fang relates the tale of a wolf born and bred in the wild which is civilised by the master he comes to trust and love. The brutal world of the Klondike miners and their dogs is brilliantly evoked and Jack London s rendering of the sentient life of Buck and White Fang as they confront their destiny is enthralling and convincing. The deeper resonance of these stories derives from the author s use of the myth of the hero who survives by strength and courage, a powerful myth that still appeals to our collective unconscious.</p><p><i>The Call Of The Wild</i> is the story of Buck, a dog stolen from his home and thrust into the merciless life of the Arctic north to endure hardship, bitter cold, and the savage lawlessness of man and beast. <i>White Fang</i> is the adventure of an animal -- part dog, part wolf --turned vicious by cruel abuse, then transformed by the patience and affection of one man. <p> Jack London's superb ability as a storyteller and his uncanny understanding of animal and human natures give these tales a striking vitality and power, and have earned him a reputation as a distinguished American writer.</p>Jack London was born into poverty in San Francisco in 1876. Before his success as a novelist, London spent a lot of time avoiding a life as a manual worker and, in the process, experienced many things that became central to his plots. He ran away from home, bought a sailing boat and became an oyster pirate - a story recounted in John Barleycorn. His best-known novel, Call of the Wild, was drawn from his own experience of the Klondike Gold Rush, a time that would inspire many of London&#39;s short stories as well. London became addicted to writing after winning a short story competition in the San Francisco Morning Call in 1893. It earned London $25, the equivalent of a month&#39;s wages. Dozens of books followed - including John Barleycorn (1913), The Call of the Wild (1903) and White Fang (1906). He published an average of three or four books a year. He died in 1916.</p><h2>Kitchen Garden Revival: A modern guide to creating a stylish, small-scale, low-maintenance, edible garden</h2><p><b>Elevate your backyard veggie patch into a work of sophisticated and stylish art. <i>Kitchen Garden Revival</i> guides you through every aspect of kitchen gardening, from design to harvesting&#x2014;with expert advice from author Nicole Burke, founder of Rooted Garden, one of the leading US culinary landscape companies, and Gardenary, an online kitchen gardening education and resource company.</b><br><br> Participating in the grow-your-own movement is important to both <b>reduce your food miles</b> and <b>control what makes it onto your family&#x2019;s table</b>.

I know tomorrow.&#x201d; This inscription in Tutankhamun&#x2019;s tomb summarizes&nbsp;<i>The Fifth Beginning</i>. Here, archaeologist Robert L. Kelly explains how the study of our cultural past can predict the future of humanity.<br> &nbsp;<br> In an eminently readable style, Kelly identifies four key pivot points in the six-million-year history of human development: the emergence of technology, culture, agriculture, and the state. In each example, the author examines the long-term processes that resulted in a definitive<i>, </i>no-turning-back&nbsp;change for the organization of society. Kelly then looks ahead, giving us evidence for what he calls a&nbsp;<i>fifth beginning</i>, one that started about AD 1500. Some might call it &#x201c;globalization,&#x201d; but the author places it in its larger context:&nbsp;a five-thousand-year arms race, capitalism&#x2019;s global reach, and the cultural effects of a worldwide communication network.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kelly predicts that the emergent phenomena of this fifth beginning will include the end of war as a viable way to resolve disputes, the end of capitalism as we know it, the widespread shift toward world citizenship, and the rise of forms of cooperation that will end the near-sacred status of nation-states. It&#x2019;s the end of life as we have known it. However, the author is cautiously optimistic: he dwells not on the coming chaos, but on humanity&#x2019;s great potential.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Fifth Beginning </i>is a benchmark book about where we came from and where we&#x2019;re likely headed. Robert L. Kelly&#x2019;s take on archaeology shows how we humans have repeatedly become something entirely different from what we intended to be. In trying to maintain the&nbsp;status quo,&nbsp;we have inadvertently triggered evolutionary changes that were ultimately transformative (and not in a good way). Kelly sounds a simple wake-up call: this time&#x2014;for the very first time&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all up to us.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Hurst Thomas, American Museum of Natural History<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In our past is our future written. Kelly brings the skills and insights of the archaeologist to the question of how we might survive in a clouded and dangerous future.

The 'subject' was the world as it culminated in the war." Published in four parts between 1924 and 1928, his extraordinary novel centers on Christopher Tietjens, an officer and gentleman-"the last English Tory"-and follows him from the secure, orderly world of Edwardian England into the chaotic madness of the First World War. Against the backdrop of a world at war, Ford recounts the complex sexual warfare between Tietjens and his faithless wife Sylvia. A work of truly amazing subtlety and profundity, <i>Parade's End</i> affirms Graham Greene's prediction: "There is no novelist of this century more likely to live than Ford Madox Ford."</p><p>This monumental novel, divided into four separate books, celebrates the end of an era, the irrevocable destruction of the comfortable, predictable society that vanished during World War I.Ford Madox Ford (1873-1939) began his career writing fairy tales before collaborating with Joseph Conrad on several novels. After publishing successful solo works, he established the <i>Transatlantic Review</i> and divided his time between France and America.</p><h2>Mcgraw-hill&#39;s 3 Evolve Reach Hesi A2 Practice Tests</h2><p>&#34;McGraw-Hill&#39;s 3 Evolve Reach (HESI) A2 practice tests helps you prepare for this important exam and achieve the high score you need to get into nursing school you desire&#34;--Back cover.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Mudworks: Creative Clay, Dough, and Modeling Experiences (1) (Bright Ideas for Learning)</h2><p>Categorized by art media,&nbsp;this book&nbsp;offers a delightfully messy range of creative activities for children to explore and experience.</p><p>HANDS-ON ART EXPLORATION FOR<br>SCHOOL ï¿½ HOMESCHOOL ï¿½ MUSEUMS ï¿½ LIBRARIES ï¿½ CHILDCARE ï¿½ HOME ï¿½ CAMP<br><br>Inside MUDWORKS experience ...<br>Funclay ï¿½&nbsp;Bead Clay ï¿½ Breadcraft ï¿½ Pate Brisee ï¿½&nbsp;Salt &amp; Stretch Goo ï¿½ Crepe Paper Jewelry ï¿½&nbsp;Spackle Relief Panel ï¿½ Gingerbread Architecture ï¿½ Tissue Mache ï¿½ Carving Paste ï¿½ Toothpaste Putty ï¿½ Strip Papier-Mache ï¿½ Doggie Biscuits ï¿½ Clay Modeling ï¿½ Sand Castle Keeper ï¿½ ad 110 more art experiences.<br><br>Discover chapters in ...<br>Playdough&nbsp;ï¿½ Bread Dough ï¿½ Plaster of Paris ï¿½ Papier-Mache ï¿½ Edible Art Dough&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;Modeling Mixtures &amp; More<br><br>*From the author of "Storybook Art" and "Discovering Great Artists"*<br>MUDWORKS was chosen by ALA for the Best of the Best Children's Media and given a starred review in Booklist, which follows:<br> "Anyone who likes to play in mud, playdough, papier-mache, and similar mediums will love this book of over 125 clay, dough, and modeling mistures.

After examining the role of the interview in the research process, Steinar Kvale considers some of the key philosophical issues relating to interviewing: the interview as conversation, hermeneutics, phenomenology, concerns about ethics as well as validity, and postmodernism. Having established this framework, the author then analyzes the seven stages of the interview process - from designing a study to writing it up. </p></p><p><p><b>Steinar Kvale</b> (1938-2008) was professor of educational psychology and director of the Centre of Qualitative Research at the University of Aarhus, and adjunct faculty at Saybrook Institute, San Francisco.

He continued his studies at the University of Heidelberg with an Alexander von Humboldt scholarship and was a visiting professor at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, and West Georgia University, Carrolton, and the University of Bergen. His long-term concern was with the implications of such continental philosophies as phenomenology, hermeneutics, and dialectics for psychology and education. </p></p><h2>Now Write!

Throughout history, the notion of two bodies has permitted the post mortem continuity of monarch and monarchy, as epitomized by the statement, "The king is dead. Long live the king." In <i>The King's Two Bodies</i>, Ernst Kantorowicz traces the historical problem posed by the "King's two bodies"--the body natural and the body politic--back to the Middle Ages and demonstrates, by placing the concept in its proper setting of medieval thought and political theory, how the early-modern Western monarchies gradually began to develop a "political theology.?</p><p>The king's natural body has physical attributes, suffers, and dies, naturally, as do all humans; but the king's other body, the spiritual body, transcends the earthly and serves as a symbol of his office as majesty with the divine right to rule. The notion of the two bodies allowed for the continuity of monarchy even when the monarch died, as summed up in the formulation "The king is dead. Long live the king."</p><p> Bringing together liturgical works, images, and polemical material, <i>The King's Two Bodies</i> explores the long Christian past behind this "political theology." It provides a subtle history of how commonwealths developed symbolic means for establishing their sovereignty and, with such means, began to establish early forms of the nation-state.</p><p> Kantorowicz fled Nazi Germany in 1938, after refusing to sign a Nazi loyalty oath, and settled in the United States. While teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, he once again refused to sign an oath of allegiance, this one designed to identify Communist Party sympathizers. He was dismissed as a result of the controversy and moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he remained for the rest of his life, and where he wrote <i>The King's Two Bodies</i>.</p><p>Featuring a new introduction, <i>The King's Two Bodies</i> is a subtle history of how commonwealths developed symbolic means for establishing their sovereignty and, with such means, began to establish early forms of the nation-state.</p></p><p><b>Ernst H. Kantorowicz</b> (1895&#x2013;1963) taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. <b>Conrad Leyser</b> is associate professor of medieval history at Worcester College, University of Oxford. He is the author of <i>Authority and Asceticism from Augustine to Gregory the Great</i>. <b>William Chester Jordan </b>is professor of history at Princeton University. He is the author of <i>From England to France: Felony and Exile in the High Middle Ages</i> (Princeton). <b> </b>"Professor Kantorowicz has written a great book, perhaps the most important work in the history of medieval political thought, surely the most spectacular, of the past several generations. Here, in superbly designed chapters based upon the best scholarship in every field even remotely concerned with the Middle Ages, is the development of the theory and symbolism of the early national states from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries."<b>---P. N. Riesenberg, <i>American Political Science Review</i></b><br><br>"There is one book that says it all. An old book, nearly a classic. . . .This book, published in 1957, is titled <i>The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology</i>."<b>---Bernard-Henri Levy, <i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>"Professor Ernst Kantorowicz has in this volume given us a monumental work of superb scholarship and profound learning, magnificently produced by Princeton University Press.

Passing a Christian church, they notice a curious sign in front that says "$1,000 to anyone who will convert." "I wonder what that's about," says Abe. "I think I'll go in and have a look. I'll be back in a minute; just wait for me."<br> <br> Sol sits on the sidewalk bench and waits patiently for nearly half an hour. Finally, Abe reappears.<br> <br> "Well," asks Sol, "what are they up to? Who are they trying to convert? Why do they care? Did you get the $1,000?"<br> <br> Indignantly Abe replies, "Money. That's all you people care about."<br> <br> Ted Cohen thinks that's not a bad joke. But he also doesn't think it's an easy joke. For a listener or reader to laugh at Abe's conversion, a complicated set of conditions must be met. First, a listener has to recognize that Abe and Sol are Jewish names. Second, that listener has to be familiar with the widespread idea that Jews are more interested in money than anything else. And finally, the listener needs to know this information in advance of the joke, and without anyone telling him or her. Jokes, in short, are complicated transactions in which communities are forged, intimacy is offered, and otherwise offensive stereotypes and cliches lose their sting&#x2014;at least sometimes.<br> <br> <i>Jokes</i> is a book of jokes and a book about them. Cohen loves a good laugh, but as a philosopher, he is also interested in how jokes work, why they work, and when they don't. The delight at the end of a joke is the result of a complex set of conditions and processes, and Cohen takes us through these conditions in a philosophical exploration of humor. He considers questions of audience, selection of joke topics, the ethnic character of jokes, and their morality, all with plenty of examples that will make you either chuckle or wince. <i>Jokes:</i> more humorous than other philosophy books, more philosophical than other humor books.<br> <br> "Befitting its subject, this study of jokes is . . . light, funny, and thought-provoking. . . . [T]he method fits the material, allowing the author to pepper the book with a diversity of jokes without flattening their humor as a steamroller theory might. Such a book is only as good as its jokes, and most of his are good. . . . [E]ntertainment and ideas in one gossamer package."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br> <br> "One of the many triumphs of Ted Cohen's Jokes-apart from the not incidental fact that the jokes are so good that he doesn't bother to compete with them-is that it never tries to sound more profound than the jokes it tells. . . . [H]e makes you feel he is doing an unusual kind of philosophy. As though he has managed to turn J. L. Austin into one of the Marx Brothers. . . . Reading Jokes makes you feel that being genial is the most profound thing we ever do-which is something jokes also make us feel-and that doing philosophy is as natural as being amused."&#x2014;Adam Phillips, <i>London Review of Books</i><br> <br> "[A] lucid and jargon-free study of the remarkable fact that we divert each other with stories meant to make us laugh. . . . An illuminating study, replete with killer jokes."&#x2014;Kevin McCardle, <i>The Herald</i> (Glasgow)<br> <br> "Cohen is an ardent joke-maker, keen to offer us a glimpse of how jokes are crafted and to have us dwell rather longer on their effects."&#x2014;Barry C. Smith, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br> <br> "Because Ted Cohen loves jokes, we come to appreciate them more, and perhaps think further about the quality of good humor and the appropriateness of laughter in our lives."&#x2014;Steve Carlson, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i></p></p><p><i>Jokes</i> is a book of jokes as well as a book about them.

White died in 1964, leaving a literary legacy that places him alongside J R.R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis and Mervyn Peake as one of the 20th Century&#39;s greatest British fantasists. He has inspired generations of fantasy writers, from Neil Gaiman to JK Rowling. Born in India in 1906, White studied at Queens&#39; College, Cambridge, where he wrote a thesis on Thomas Malory&#39;s Le Morte d&#39;Arthur. He found success with his &#39;preface to Malory&#39;, The Sword in the Stone, a wonderfully imaginative retelling of King Arthur&#39;s early life. He continued to explore the Arthurian mythos in four further volumes - The Witch in the Wood, The Ill-Made Knight, The Candle in the Wind and The Book of Merlyn - a sequence collectively known as The Once and Future King. The novels were famously adapted into the Disney film The Sword in the Stone in 1963.<p>ONE</p><p>On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays it was Court Hand and Summulae Logicales, while the rest of the week it was the Organon, Repetition and Astrology. The governess was always getting muddled with her astrolabe, and when she got specially muddled she would take it out of the Wart by rapping his knuckles. She did not rap Kay&#x2019;s knuckles, because when Kay grew older he would be Sir Kay, the master of the estate. The Wart was called the Wart because it more or less rhymed with Art, which was short for his real name. Kay had given him the nickname. Kay was not called anything but Kay, as he was too dignified to have a nickname and would have flown into a passion if anybody had tried to give him one. The governess had red hair and some mysterious wound from which she derived a lot of prestige by showing it to all the women of the castle, behind closed doors. It was believed to be where she sat down, and to have been caused by sitting on some armour at a picnic by mistake. Eventually she offered to show it to Sir Ector, who was Kay&#x2019;s father, had hysterics and was sent away. They found out afterwards that she had been in a lunatic hospital for three years.</p><p>In the afternoons the programme was: Mondays and Fridays, tilting and horsemanship; Tuesdays, hawking; Wednesdays, fencing; Thursdays, archery; Saturdays, the theory of chivalry, with the proper measures to be blown on all occasions, terminology of the chase and hunting etiquette. If you did the wrong thing at the mort or the undoing, for instance, you were bent over the body of the dead beast and smacked with the flat side of a sword. This was called being bladed. It was horseplay, a sort of joke like being shaved when crossing the line. Kay was not bladed, although he often went wrong.</p><p>When they had got rid of the governess, Sir Ector said, &#x201c;After all, damn it all, we can&#x2019;t have the boys runnin&#x2019; about all day like hooligans&#x2014;after all, damn it all? Ought to be havin&#x2019; a first-rate eddication, at their age. When I was their age I was doin&#x2019; all this Latin and stuff at five o&#x2019;clock every mornin&#x2019;. Happiest time of me life. Pass the port.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Grummore Grummursum, who was staying the night because he had been benighted out questin&#x2019; after a specially long run, said that when he was their age he was swished every mornin&#x2019; because he would go hawkin&#x2019; instead of learnin&#x2019;. He attributed to this weakness the fact that he could never get beyond the Future Simple of Utor. It was a third of the way down the left-hand leaf, he said. He thought it was leaf ninety-seven. He passed the port.</p><p>Sir Ector said, &#x201c;Had a good quest today?&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Grummore said, &#x201c;Oh, not so bad. Rattlin&#x2019; good day, in fact. Found a chap called Sir Bruce Saunce Pitï¿½ choppin&#x2019; off a maiden&#x2019;s head in Weedon Bushes, ran him to Mixbury Plantation in the Bicester, where he doubled back, and lost him in Wicken Wood. Must have been a good twenty-five miles as he ran.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A straight-necked &#x2019;un,&#x201d; said Sir Ector.</p><p>&#x201c;But about these boys and all this Latin and that,&#x201d; added the old gentleman. &#x201c;Amo, amas, you know, and runnin&#x2019; about like hooligans: what would you advise?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, laying his finger by his nose and winking at the bottle, &#x201c;that takes a deal of thinkin&#x2019; about, if you don&#x2019;t mind my sayin&#x2019; so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind at all,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;Very kind of you to say anythin&#x2019;. Much obliged, I&#x2019;m sure. Help yourself to port.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good port this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get it from a friend of mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But about these boys,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;How many of them are there, do you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;counting them both, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t send them to Eton, I suppose?&#x201d; inquired Sir Grummore cautiously. &#x201c;Long way and all that, we know.&#x201d;</p><p>It was not really Eton that he mentioned, for the College of Blessed Mary was not founded until 1440, but it was a place of the same sort. Also they were drinking Metheglyn, not port, but by mentioning the modern wine it is easier to give you the feel.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t so much the distance,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;but that giant What&#x2019;s-&#x2019;is-name is in the way. Have to pass through his country, you understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is his name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t recollect it at the moment, not for the life of me. Fellow that lives by the Burbly Water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Galapas,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the very chap.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other thing,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to have a tutor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;A tutor, you know, a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have some more port,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;You need it after all this questin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Splendid day,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;Only they never seem to kill nowadays. Run twenty-five miles and then mark to ground or lose him altogether. The worst is when you start a fresh quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We kill all our giants cubbin&#x2019;,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;After that they give you a fine run, but get away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Run out of scent,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;I dare say. It&#x2019;s always the same with these big giants in a big country. They run out of scent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But even if you was to have a tutor,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how you would get him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Advertise,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;I have advertised,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;It was cried by the <i>Humberland Newsman and Cardoile Advertiser</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other way,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to start a quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a quest for a tutor,&#x201d; explained Sir Ector.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hic, Haec, Hoc,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;Have some more of this drink, whatever it calls itself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hunc,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>So it was decided. When Grummore Grummursum had gone home next day, Sir Ector tied a knot in his handkerchief to remember to start a quest for a tutor as soon as he had time to do so, and, as he was not sure how to set about it, he told the boys what Sir Grummore had suggested and warned them not to be hooligans meanwhile. Then they went hay-making.</p><p>It was July, and every able-bodied man and woman on the estate worked during that month in the field, under Sir Ector&#x2019;s direction. In any case the boys would have been excused from being eddicated just then.</p><p>Sir Ector&#x2019;s castle stood in an enormous clearing in a still more enormous forest. It had a courtyard and a moat with pike in it. The moat was crossed by a fortified stone bridge which ended half-way across it. The other half was covered by a wooden drawbridge which was wound up every night. As soon as you had crossed the drawbridge you were at the top of the village street&#x2014;it had only one street&#x2014;and this extended for about half a mile, with thatched houses of wattle and daub on either side of it. The street divided the clearing into two huge fields, that on the left being cultivated in hundreds of long narrow strips, while that on the right ran down to a river and was used as pasture. Half of the right-hand field was fenced off for hay.</p><p>It was July, and real July weather, such as they had in Old England. Everybody went bright brown, like Red Indians, with startling teeth and flashing eyes. The dogs moved about with their tongues hanging out, or lay panting in bits of shade, while the farm horses sweated through their coats and flicked their tails and tried to kick the horse-flies off their bellies with their great hind hoofs. In the pasture field the cows were on the gad, and could be seen galloping about with their tails in the air, which made Sir Ector angry.</p><p>Sir Ector stood on the top of a rick, whence he could see what everybody was doing, and shouted commands all over the two-hundred-acre field, and grew purple in the face. The best mowers mowed away in a line where the grass was still uncut, their scythes roaring in the strong sunlight. The women raked the dry hay together in long strips with wooden rakes, and the two boys with pitchforks followed up on either side of the strip, turning the hay inwards so that it lay well for picking up. Then the great carts followed, rumbling with their spiked wooden wheels, drawn by horses or slow white oxen. One man stood on top of the cart to receive the hay and direct operations, while one man walked on either side picking up what the boys had prepared and throwing it to him with a fork. The cart was led down the lane between two lines of hay, and was loaded in strict rotation from the front poles to the back, the man on top calling out in a stern voice where he wanted each fork to be pitched. The loaders grumbled at the boys for not having laid the hay properly and threatened to tan them when they caught them, if they got left behind.</p><p>When the wagon was loaded, it was drawn to Sir Ector&#x2019;s rick and pitched to him. It came up easily because it had been loaded systematically&#x2014;not like modern hay&#x2014;and Sir Ector scrambled about on top, getting in the way of his assistants, who did the real work, and stamping and perspiring and scratching about with his fork and trying to make the rick grow straight and shouting that it would all fall down as soon as the west winds came.</p><p>The Wart loved hay-making, and was good at it. Kay, who was two years older, generally stood on the edge of the bundle which he was trying to pick up, with the result that he worked twice as hard as the Wart for only half the result. But he hated to be beaten at anything, and used to fight away with the wretched hay&#x2014;which he loathed like poison&#x2014;until he was quite sick.</p><p>The day after Sir Grummore&#x2019;s visit was sweltering for the men who toiled from milking to milking and then again till sunset in their battle with the sultry element. For the hay was an element to them, like sea or air, in which they bathed and plunged themselves and which they even breathed in. The seeds and small scraps stuck in their hair, their mouths, their nostrils, and worked, tickling, inside their clothes. They did not wear many clothes, and the shadows between their sliding muscles were blue on the nut-brown skins. Those who feared thunder had felt ill that morning.</p><p>In the afternoon the storm broke. Sir Ector kept them at it till the great flashes were right overhead, and then, with the sky as dark as night, the rain came hurling against them so that they were drenched at once and could not see a hundred yards. The boys lay crouched under the wagons, wrapped in hay to keep their wet bodies warm against the now cold wind, and all joked with one another while heaven fell. Kay was shivering, though not with cold, but he joked like the others because he would not show he was afraid. At the last and greatest thunderbolt every man startled involuntarily, and each saw the other startle, until they laughed away their shame.</p><p>But that was the end of the hay-making and the beginning of play. The boys were sent home to change their clothes. The old dame who had been their nurse fetched dry jerkins out of a press, and scolded them for catching their deaths, and denounced Sir Ector for keeping on so long. Then they slipped their heads into the laundered shirts, and ran out to the refreshed and sparkling court.</p><p>&#x201c;I vote we take Cully and see if we can get some rabbits in the chase,&#x201d; cried the Wart.</p><p>&#x201c;The rabbits will not be out in this wet,&#x201d; said Kay sarcastically, delighted to have caught him over natural history.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on. It will soon be dry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I must carry Cully, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Kay insisted on carrying the goshawk and flying her, when they went hawking together. This he had a right to do, not only because he was older than the Wart but also because he was Sir Ector&#x2019;s proper son. The Wart was not a proper son. He did not understand this, but it made him feel unhappy, because Kay seemed to regard it as making him inferior in some way. Also it was different not having a father and mother, and Kay had taught him that being different was wrong. Nobody talked to him about it, but he thought about it when he was alone, and was distressed. He did not like people to bring it up. Since the other boy always did bring it up when a question of precedence arose, he had got into the habit of giving in at once before it could be mentioned. Besides, he admired Kay and was a born follower. He was a hero-worshipper.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; cried the Wart, and they scampered off toward the Mews, turning a few cartwheels on the way.</p></p><h2>French Farmhouse Cookbook</h2><p>As much a book of inspiration as a collection of over 250 uncommonly delicious recipes, <i>French Farmhouse Cookbook</i> captures the rustic and richly flavored farmhouse cooking that is the basis of French cuisine and a perennial inspiration of French chefs.

S.E.S. ï¿½ AudioFile 2000, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright ï¿½ AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Bourgeois Equality: How Ideas, Not Capital or Institutions, Enriched the World</h2><p>&nbsp;There&#x2019;s little doubt that most humans today are better off than their forebears. Stunningly so, the economist and historian Deirdre McCloskey argues in the concluding volume of her trilogy celebrating the oft-derided virtues of the bourgeoisie. The poorest of humanity, McCloskey shows, will soon be joining the comparative riches of Japan and Sweden and Botswana.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why? Most economists&#x2014;from Adam Smith and Karl Marx to Thomas Piketty&#x2014;say the Great Enrichment since 1800 came from accumulated capital. McCloskey disagrees, fiercely. &#x201c;Our riches,&#x201d; she argues, &#x201c;were made not by piling brick on brick, bank balance on bank balance, but by piling idea on idea.&#x201d; Capital was necessary, but so was the presence of oxygen. It was ideas, not matter, that drove &#x201c;trade-tested betterment.&#x201d;&nbsp; Nor were institutions the drivers. The World Bank orthodoxy of &#x201c;add institutions and stir&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t work, and didn&#x2019;t. McCloskey builds a powerful case for the initiating role of ideas&#x2014;ideas for electric motors and free elections, of course, but more deeply the bizarre and liberal ideas of equal liberty and dignity for ordinary folk. Liberalism arose from theological and political revolutions in northwest Europe, yielding a unique respect for betterment and its practitioners, and upending ancient hierarchies. Commoners were encouraged to have a go, and the bourgeoisie took up the Bourgeois Deal, and we were all enriched.<br> &nbsp;<br> Few economists or historians write like McCloskey&#x2014;her ability to invest the facts of economic history with the urgency of a novel, or of a leading case at law, is unmatched. She summarizes modern economics and modern economic history with verve and lucidity, yet sees through to the really big scientific conclusion. Not matter, but ideas. Big books don&#x2019;t come any more ambitious, or captivating, than <i>Bourgeois Equality</i>.</p><p><b>Deirdre Nansen McCloskey </b>is an emerita distinguished professor of economics and of history, and professor of English and of communications at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She is the author of sixteen other books, including <i>If You&#x2019;re So Smart, The Secret Sins of Economics, The Bourgeois Virtues</i>, <i>Bourgeois Dignity</i>, and <i>Crossing: A Memoir</i>, all published by the University of Chicago Press."It took me two months to read this 650-page, small-type book, the third volume in a trilogy. In that time I read several other books, absorbing <i>Bourgeois Equality</i>&nbsp;in small doses on trains, ships, Tubes, sofas and beds. If that sounds like faint praise, it's not. I wanted to savour every sentence of this remarkable feast of prose. It is a giant of a book about a giant of a topic: the &#x2018;great enrichment&#x2019; of humanity over the past 300 years. It is so rich in vocabulary, allusion and fact as to be a contender for the great book of the great book of our age. Dump your copy of Thomas Piketty and put Deirdre McCloskey on the bookshelf instead." (Matt Ridley <i>The Times, Book of the Week</i>)<br><br>"It has always seemed to me that history is overdetermined, so any attempt to pick out a single cause will be doomed, and yet McCloskey's insistence on the essential role of what she variously calls ideas, ideology, ethics or rhetoric&#x2014;the social acceptability of bourgeois folk engaging honourably in business&#x2014;is persuasive. . . . <i>Bourgeois Equality</i> is richly detailed and erudite, and it will join its companion volumes as essential reading on the industrial revolution, as well as a model of the intellectual depth and breadth achievable through the study of economics." (Diane Coyle <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>"A sparkling book. . . . McCloskey makes a convincing case." (Martin Wolf <i>Financial Times, Best Books of Early 2016</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;McCloskey has spent a long and distinguished career asserting the efficacy of free markets in goods and labour. . . . Unusually versed in philosophy and literature, she has acted as something of a domestic chaplain for the Chicago school of economists, ministering to the spiritual state of <i>Homo economicus</i>. . . .

Years of a chair-bound lifestyle were taking their toll. Realizing that the old bodybuilding approach was no way to tackle the stiffness, weakness, and aches and pains that come with age, he set off on a journey of discovery and transformation. With help from the experts, he developed a common-sense, step-by-step program that can be tailored to any level of physical ability. Along the way he learned why cardio machines aren't enough, what it takes to be "functionally fit" for daily life, and how to stay motivated. Today, Owen is in better shape than he was at 25, and he is a passionate evangelist for fitness as a way of life. He has proved that you don't have to be powerless in the face of advancing years: if you make a commitment to "just move," you can take charge of the aging process and make your coming years the best they can be.<br><br>The book is divided into two sections, with the first providing fascinating information and the second showing step-by-step details of how to put the best fitness principles into practice.</p><p>JAMES P.

Drawing on more than thirty years of experience in higher education as a student, faculty member, and administrator, Roche deftly connects the broad theoretical perspective of educators to the practical needs and questions of students and their parents. Roche develops three overlapping arguments for a strong liberal arts education: first, the intrinsic value of learning for its own sake, including exploration of the profound questions that give meaning to life; second, the cultivation of intellectual virtues necessary for success beyond the academy; and third, the formative influence of the liberal arts on character and on the development of a sense of higher purpose and vocation. Together with his exploration of these three values&#x2015;intrinsic, practical, and idealistic&#x2015;Roche reflects on ways to integrate them, interweaving empirical data with personal experience. <i>Why Choose the Liberal Arts?</i> is an accessible and thought-provoking work of interest to students, parents, and administrators.</p><p>Mark William Roche is the Rev.

It will prove valuable reading for anyone concerned with the state of the modern university and the future of the liberal arts.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Writing with students, parents, faculty members, and administrators in mind, Roche argues for the importance of a liberal arts education and outlines its three important values: intrinsic, practical, and idealist. He shows how this education is valuable for learning for its own sake, cultivates intellectual virtues necessary for success beyond college, and has a formative influence on character and the development of a sense of higher purpose and vocation.&#x201d; (<i>Book News Inc.</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In a resistant country in a resistant age, Mark Roche dares to make the case for education in the liberal arts in terms both broad and deep. He makes forcefully the obligatory case for the practical value of a liberal arts education as a preparation for whatever profession&#x2015;a case that must continue to be made, especially in these times. But on the basis of wide reading and long experience as a scholar, teacher, and administrator in institutions large and small, he straightforwardly makes the case for the inherent value of study in the liberal arts and for the intimate relationship between that study and what life might actually be about. He foregrounds the truly big questions that are so often avoided in pursuit of the professional by both students and faculty. Unlike so many commentators, he is not a scold. He is a thoughtful advocate for an education in which young and old alike explore together what it means to be a human being and how one might be a better one.&#x201d; (Don Michael Randel, President, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation)<br><br>&#x201c;Roche has written a very thoughtful and fair <i>apologia</i> for the liberal arts that speaks to many contemporary challenges. Not only prospective students but current faculty can richly benefit from the author&#x2019;s extensive administrative and teaching experience. The creative teaching methods he cites as examples throughout the book can serve as valuable models for teachers in almost any field.&#x201d; (<i>Anglican and Episcopal History</i>)</p><h2>First Language Lessons for the Well-Trained Mind</h2><p><p><strong>Parents can assure their child's success in language arts with this simple-to-use, scripted guide.</strong></p><em>First Language Lessons for the Well-Trained Mind</em> uses picture study and other classical techniques to develop the child's language study in those first two all-important years of school.

Davis (City Lights Open Media)</h2><p><p>A masterpiece of African American literature, Frederick Douglass's <i>Narrative</i> is the powerful story of an enslaved youth coming into social and moral consciousness by disobeying his white slavemasters and secretly teaching himself to read. Achieving literacy emboldens Douglass to resist, escape, and ultimately achieve his freedom. After escaping slavery, Douglass became a leader in the anti-slavery and women's rights movements, a bestselling author, and U.S. diplomat.</p><p>In this new critical edition, legendary activist and feminist scholar Angela Davis sheds new light on the legacy of Frederick Douglass. In two philosophical lectures originally delivered at UCLA in autumn 1969, Davis focuses on Douglass's intellectual and spiritual awakening, and the importance of self-knowledge in achieving freedom from all forms of oppression. With detailed attention to Douglass's text, she interrogates the legacy of slavery and shares timeless lessons about oppression, resistance, and freedom. And in an extended introductory essay written for this edition, Davis comments on previous editions of the <i>Narrative</i> and re-examines Douglass through a contemporary feminist perspective. An important new edition of an American classic.</p><p>"Angela Y. Davis presents a long overdue examination of Douglass' work not just from the perspective of a woman but one of the most provocative and profound minds of the last half century. It is my sincere hope that this City Lights edition of <i>The Narrative </i>will inspire researchers and individuals to take a closer look at the tremendous degree of influence Anna Murray Douglass had in the life and the career of her husband and my great-great-great grandfather." &#x2014;Kenneth B.

It evoked scorn in the North and outrage in the South. Yet they were the harbingers of things to come. They were on the right side of history. Prof. Angela Y. Davis stands in that proud, radical tradition." &#x2014;Mumia Abu-Jamal, author of <i>Jailhouse Lawyers: Prisoners Defending Prisoners v. the U.S.A.</i></p><p>"Behold the heart and mind of Angela Davis, open, relentless, and on time!" &#x2014;June Jordan</p><p>"The enormous revolution in Black consciousness which has occurred in your generation, my dear sister, means the beginning or the end of America. Some of us, white and Black, know how great a price has already been paid to bring into existence a new consciousness, a new people in an unprecedented nation. If we know, and do nothing, we are worse than the murderers hired in our name. If we know, then we must fight for your life as though it were our own&#x2014;which it is&#x2014;and render impassable with our bodies the corridor to the gas chamber. For, if they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night." &#x2014;James Baldwin</p></p><p>Douglass escaped slavery in 1838 and became a tireless campaigner for abolitionism.

Tour.</p><p>In 1900 the West was still wild. Anglo-Americans were tearing up the countryside in the name of progress, and pity the Indians who stood in the way. To this canvas Leslie Marmon Silko, author of such well-received novels as <i>Almanac of the Dead</i> and <i>Ceremony</i>, brings her brush. <i>Gardens in the Dunes</i> begins and ends at a hidden garden near the Colorado River on the California-Arizona border. But Silko covers ground that includes the early stages of women's rights, emerging female sexuality, the rape of the Amazon, early quack medicine, Gnostic mysteries, Celtic magic, and flower husbandry. Her palette has many colors, but everywhere the garden is a central theme. <p> Grandmother Fleet, one of the few remaining Sand Lizard Indians, tends a traditional desert garden while teaching the old ways to her granddaughters Sister Salt and Indigo. At a time of crushing hopelessness, Wovoka's Ghost Dance messianic movement appears, drawing in the girls and Grandmother Fleet: </p><blockquote> While the others danced with eyes focussed on the fire, Indigo watched the weird shadows play on the hillsides, so she was one of the first to see the Messiah and his family as they stepped out of darkness into the glow of swirling snowflakes. How their white robes shined! </blockquote> Indigo is also one of the first to sense the approach of soldiers and Indian police bent on breaking up the gathering. The action then moves her from the secret garden and small family to an Indian school in Riverside. She eventually flees the school and ends up traveling through Europe with an aristocratic Victorian family, as companion to an unmarried woman. Despite her many adventures and her exposure to a life of privilege and luxury, Indigo never loses her affinity for the traditions of her own people. Silko uses this novel to explore contrasts between Native American and European customs and morals--with white culture often coming up short. On occasion this ambitious novel strays into the political proper, but there's no denying the sheer force of Silko's prose and the sweep of her story. <i>Gardens in the Dunes</i> offers both a vivid portrait of 19th-century Native American life and a provocative exploration of disparate cultures' relationships to the world around them <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i>A sweeping, multifaceted tale of a young Native American pulled between the cherished traditions of a heritage on the brink of extinction and an encroaching white culture, Gardens in the Dunes is the powerful tale of one woman's quest to reconcile two worlds that are diametrically opposed.<p>At the center of this struggle is Indigo, who is ripped from her tribe, the Sand Lizard people, by white soldiers who destroy her home and family. Placed in a government school to learn the ways of a white child, Indigo is rescued by the kind-hearted Hattie and her worldly husband Edward, who undertake to transform this complex, spirited girl into a "proper" young lady. Bit by bit, and through a wondrous journey that spans the European continent, traipses through the jungles of Brazil, and returns to the rich desert of Southwest America, Indigo bridges the gap between the two forces in her life and teaches her adoptive parents as much as, if not more than, she learns from them.</p></p><h2>Frontera: Margaritas, Guacamoles, and Snacks</h2><p><p><strong>A brand-new collection from America&#x2019;s leading authority on Mexican cooking.</strong></p> For years, fans have urged Rick Bayless to collect recipes for his prized margaritas, guacamoles, and snacks in one book.

Like a virtual scourge, the illuminated glowing faces&#x2015;the Glow Kids&#x2015;are multiplying. But at what cost? Is this just a harmless indulgence or fad like some sort of digital hula-hoop?

Brain imaging research is showing that stimulating glowing screens are as dopaminergic (dopamine activating) to the brain&#x2019;s pleasure center as sex. And a growing mountain of clinical research correlates screen tech with disorders like ADHD, addiction, anxiety, depression, increased aggression, and even psychosis. Most shocking of all, recent brain imaging studies conclusively show that excessive screen exposure can neurologically damage a young person&#x2019;s developing brain in the same way that cocaine addiction can. </p><p>Kardaras will dive into the sociological, psychological, cultural, and economic factors involved in the global tech epidemic with one major goal: to explore the effect all of our wonderful shiny new technology is having on kids. <i>Glow Kids</i> also includes an opt-out letter and a "quiz" for parents in the back of the book.</p></p><p>DR.

Soon after its initial publication, the <i>Harvard Dictionary of Music</i> by Willi Apel was firmly established as a standard and essential resource for everyone concerned with music. The product of exceptional scholarship, it was praised as being comprehensive, concise, authoritative, scholarly, and enjoyable. Leopold Stokowski wrote, "I so often consult your dictionary of music, and with such never failing enlightenment, that I must offer you my thanks for your unique book, so profound and so broad in scope ... The vast scholarship... is of immeasurable value to the whole world of music." The <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> called it "a highly satisfying book of musical knowledge, in which basic definitions are given with fine intellectual integrity, and musical facts are carefully separated from plausible deductions or theories." </p><p> </p><p> For this second edition the dictionary has been thoroughly revised, updated, and substantially enlarged. Mr. Apel and eightyeight other eminent music scholars have contributed new articles and revised old ones completely. The already comprehensive list of accurate definitions has grown measurably and it now even includes <i>nothus, pyiba</i>, and <i>meringue</i>. </p><p> </p><p> In the greatly expanded coverage of ethnomusicology, <i>cumbia</i>-an Afro-Panamanian dance form - and <i>Vietnam</i> are only two of the new entries. Additionally, all the general information about individual countries has been revised and the discussion of both theory and history has been amply increased. Developments of the last two decades are given special attention with particular emphasis on compositional techniques, including electronic music and serial music. Individual compositions, representative of every type from every era, are described. </p><p> </p><p> The bibliography following each article, a unique feature of the first edition, has been updated and expanded. There are fifty percent more illustrations than in the first edition, including explicit drawings of instruments, clear music examples, diagrams, charts and a full-page outline of the history of music. </p><p> </p><p> An extensive list of the most important music libraries and collections throughout the world with summaries of their significant musical holdings is a valuable part of the dictionary. The section on historical editions now lists fifty-three collections of music and briefly describes each volume within each collection. </p><p> </p><p> The <i>Harvard Dictionary of Music, Second Edition, Revised and Enlarged</i>, is the result of imaginative, specialized, modern, and reliable music scholarship. Containing nearly 1000 pages of precise and accessible information on all musical subjects, it offers over fifty percent more material than the first edition.

Whether it&#x2019;s from <i>Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon, The Karate Kid, </i>or <i>Kung Fu Panda,</i> Jackie is admired by generations of moviegoers for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and mind-bending stunts. In 2016&#x2014;after fifty-six years in the industry, over 200 films, and many broken bones&#x2014;he received an honorary Academy Award for his lifetime achievement in film. But at 64 years-old, Jackie is just getting started.<br> <br>Now, in <i>Never Grow Up</i>, the global superstar reflects on his early life, including his childhood years at the China Drama Academy (in which he was enrolled at the age of six), his big breaks (and setbacks) in Hong Kong and Hollywood, his numerous brushes with death (both on and off film sets), and his life as a husband and father (which has been, admittedly and regrettably, imperfect).<br> <br>Jackie has never shied away from his mistakes. Since <i>The Young Master </i>in 1980, Jackie&#x2019;s films have ended with a bloopers reel in which he stumbles over his lines, misses his mark, or crashes to the ground in a stunt gone south. In <i>Never Grow Up</i>, Jackie applies the same spirit of openness to his life, proving time and time again why he&#x2019;s beloved the world over: he&#x2019;s honest, funny, kind, brave beyond reckoning and&#x2014;after all this time&#x2014;still young at heart.</p><p>Jackie Chan is a martial artist, actor, film director, producer, stuntman, and philanthropist.

Six years later, with the publication of <i>Look Homeward, Angel,</i> Wolfe gave the world proof of his genius, and he would continue to do so throughout his tumultuous life. <br> <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i> is the coming-of-age story of Eugene Gant, whose restlessness and yearning to experience life to the fullest take him from his rural home in North Carolina to Harvard. Through his rich, ornate prose and meticulous attention to detail, Wolfe evokes the peculiarities of small-town life and the pain and upheaval of leaving home. Heavily autobiographical, <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i> is Wolfe's most turbulent and passionate work, and a brilliant novel of lasting impact.</p><p><i>Look Homeward, Angel</i> is an elaborate and moving coming-of-age story about Eugene Gant, a restless and energetic character whose passion to experience life takes him from his small, rural hometown in North Carolina to Harvard University and the city of Boston. The novel's pattern is artfully simple -- a small town, a large family, high school and college -- yet the characters are monumental in their graphic individuality and personality. <p> Through his rich, ornate prose, Wolfe evokes the extraordinarily vivid family of the Gants, and with equal detail, the remarkable peculiarities of small-town life and the pain and upheaval of a boy who must leave both. A classic work of American literature, Look Homeward, Angel is a passionate, stirring, and unforgettable novel. </p>Thomas Wolfe (1900&#x2013;1938) was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and educated at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University. He taught English at New York University and traveled extensively in Europe and America. Wolfe created his legacy as a classic American novelist with <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>; <i>Of Time and the River</i>; <i>A Stone, a Leaf, a Door</i>; and <i>From Death to Morning</i>.</p><h2>Vampires, Burial, and Death: Folklore and Reality</h2><p>In this engrossing book, Paul Barber surveys centuries of folklore about vampires and offers the first scientific explanation for the origins of the vampire legends. From the tale of a sixteenth-century shoemaker from Breslau whose ghost terrorized everyone in the city, to the testimony of a doctor who presided over the exhumation and dissection of a graveyard full of Serbian vampires, his book is fascinating reading.</p><p>Barber has written a stimulating, authoritative discourse on the relationship between the historical concepts of vampires in folklore and fiction across the ages and throughout the world. To explain the underlying myraid interment and mourning practices designed to keep the dead at bay, he postulates a universal fear of the"vampire/revenant." Such fear was most probably based on universal lack of knowledge and control over fatal illness and disease, and misinterpretations of the natural (and varied) physical manifestations of death and decay in the human body.

Rooted in the theory of psychoanalytic self-psychology as put forth by Heinz Kohut and his colleagues, <i>Treating the Self</i> focuses specifically on the application of the self-psychological concept of the psyche to the actual conduct of psychoanalytic treatment. The result is not a ``how to'' approach, but rather a volume that suggests a theory of treatment and offers its readers guidelines for new ways of thinking about therapy. Based on the author's own familiarity of the therapeutic process, it concentrates on the detailed experiences of both the analyst and analysand, and demonstrates ways of creating and attitude and ambience that facilitates and guides successful treatment. Written by Ernest Wolf, a close collaborator of Heinz Kohut, this volume is a personal account of the process of self-psychology presented by one of the foremost experts in the field.<br>Divided into two parts, the volume's first section provides an general orientation to the field. It includes a review of self-psychology's historical development, and elaboration of basic concepts, and an introduction to the Kohutian concepts of selfobject transference and narcissistic rage. A unique feature of this section is a chapter that provides, for the first time in a text, a comprehensive classification of disorders of the self with illustrative clinical vignettes. Part II, which focuses on treatment, explicates the principles and process of treatment, and offers in-depth discussion of such topics as analytic reality, countertransference, and the problems and process of termination.<br>An outstanding contribution to the development and understanding of the process of self-psychology, <i>Treating the Self</i> is an invaluable resource for psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, psychologists, social workers, and pastoral counselors.

Prayer, our conversation with God, needs no set formulas or flowery phrases. It often needs no words at all. But for most believers, the words of others can be a wonderful aid to devotion, especially when these words come front faithful fellow pilgrims. <i>The African Prayer Book</i> is just such an aid, for in this collection all the spiritual riches of the vast and varied continent of Africa are bravely set forth. Here we may delight in Solomon's splendid encounter with the Queen of Sheba, overhear the simple prayer of a penniless Bushman, and glory in the sensuous sonorities of the mysterious liturgies of the Egyptian Copts. Here are Jesus' own encounters with Africa, which provided him refuge at the beginning of his life (from the murderous King Herod) and aid at its end (in the person of Simon of Cyrene, who helped Jesus carry his cross). Here are the prayers of some of the greatest among the mothers and fathers of the Church -- Monica, Augustine, Clement of Alexandria, Cyprian of Carthag -- as well as the prayers from the African diasporas of North America and the Caribbean. From thunderous multi-invocation litanies to quiet meditations, here are prayers that every heart can speak with strength and confidence. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is for millions the very soul of Africa, is our guide on this unique spiritual journey. His introduction is destined to become a classic, his characteristic energy and optimism light our way, and the words of his favorite prayers (many composed by the Archbishop himself) will stay with us forever.</p><p>DESMOND TUTU, the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, retired as Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, in 1996 and was later named as Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission by Nelson Mandela. He lives in South Africa and lectures throughout the world.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Adoration<br>All of us are by nature worshipful. We may worship God to whom we ascribe his due, his worth. That is true worship. Or, we may give a false worship to money, to status, etc. When we listen to a superb Beethoven symphony, or something out of Handel's <i>Messiah</i>, we are often speechless with wonder and awe. Are we not often awestruck before the grandeur of some imposing mountain range, or when we behold a glorious sunset, or a still, moonlit night with the stars winking in a dark blue sky? I once heard a venerable professor of gynecology, who must have delivered countless babies, confess that he was always overwhelmed by the wonder and mystery of a baby being born. I have heard that scientists wax ecstatic and break into poetic utterance because of the aesthetic qualities of some scientific experiment and the truth that it will have proven. Archimedes ran naked out of his bath when a new scientific truth struck him, shouting "Eureka, eureka" ("I have found it!") In the presence of a good and holy person most of us will be overcome with awe. Standing near Mother Teresa, or Helder Camara, or Nelson Mandela, or Mahatma Gandhi, you know you are standing on holy ground.<br><br>On such occasions words are often so utterly inadequate. The story goes of a farmer who used to sit in church for long periods of silence. When he was asked about this practice, he said of our Lord, "I look at him and he looks at me and it is enough." We too have moments when we are struck speechless, as when we are stunned by the beauty of the snowcapped Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, or the majestic roar of the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Our instinctive worshipfulness then comes to the fore with all these created things; how much more when we encounter the Source of it all--God, who is Beauty, Truth and Goodness? Then we want to fall down to worship and adore the one whose glory fills the heavens and the earth. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts."<br>O all ye big things of the earth<br>bless ye the Lord . . .<br>. . . all ye small things bless ye the Lord . . .<br><br>Isn't that beautiful?<br><br>All shall be Amen and Alleluia.<br>We shall rest and we shall see,<br>We shall see and we shall know,<br>We shall know and we shall love,<br>We shall love and we shall praise.<br>Behold our end which is no end.<br>Somebody remarked that our praise will not end, because we will for ever discover new aspects of God's beauty, holiness and goodness; for God is infinite, and we are and will always be finite, and so we will be "lost" in wonder, love and praise, as the hymn puts it.<br><br>In adoration we begin where we should--with God--by putting first things first. Our Lord taught his disciples a special prayer and it began with God, "Our Father," and then proceeds to glorify and adore him: "hallowed be thy name." In starting with adoration, we follow the pattern our Lord left us.<br><br><i>The day of Pentecost had come, and they were all together in one place. Suddenly there came from the sky what sounded like a strong, driving wind, a noise which filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them flames like tongues of fire distributed among them and coming to rest on each one. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to talk in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them power of utterance.<br><br>Now there were staying in Jerusalem devout Jews drawn from every nation under heaven. At this sound a crowd of them gathered, and were bewildered because each one heard his own language spoken; they were amazed and in astonishment exclaimed, "Surely these people who are speaking are all Galileans! How is it that each of us can hear them in his own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites; inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea and Cappadocia, of Pontus and Asia, of Phrygia and Pamphylia, of Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes; Cretans and Arabs--all of us hear them telling in our own tongues the great things God has done."</i><br><br>-Acts 2:1-11<br>An African Canticle<br><br>All you<i> big</i> things, bless the Lord.<br>Mount Kilimanjaro and Lake Victoria,<br>The Rift Valley and the Serengeti Plain,<br>Fat baobabs and shady mango trees,<br>All eucalyptus and tamarind trees,<br>Bless the Lord.<br>Praise and extol Him for ever and ever.<br><br>All you <i>tiny</i> things, bless the Lord.<br>Busy black ants and hopping fleas,<br>Wriggling tadpoles and mosquito larvae,<br>Flying locusts and water drops,<br>Pollen dust and tsetse flies,<br>Millet seeds and dried dagaa,<br>Bless the Lord.<br>Praise and extol Him for ever and ever.<br><br>-Traditional African<br>Today Is God<br><br>In the beginning was God,<br>Today is God,<br>Tomorrow will be God.<br>Who can make an image of God?<br>He has no body.<br>He is the word which comes out of your mouth.<br>That word!

And thee would man praise, man but a particle of thy creation, man that bears about him his mortality, the witness of his sin, that thou resistest the proud. Yet would man praise thee, he but a particle of thy creation. Thou awakenest us to delight in thy praise. For thou madest us for thyself and our heart is restless until it rest in thee. Grant me, Lord, to know and understand which is first--to call on thee or to praise thee? And again, to know thee or to call on thee? For who can call on thee, not knowing thee?

Over time, Fanny comes to demonstrate forcibly those virtues Austen most admired: modesty, firm principles, and a loving heart. As Fanny watches her cousins Maria and Julia cast aside their scruples in dangerous flirtations (and worse), and as she herself resolutely resists the advantages of marriage to the fascinating but morally unsteady Henry Crawford, her seeming austerity grows in appeal and makes clear&nbsp;why she was Austen&#x2019;s own favorite among her heroines.<br><br><i>Mansfield Park </i>encompasses not only Austen&#x2019;s great comedic gifts and her genius as a historian of the human animal, but her personal credo as well&#x2014;her faith in a social order that combats chaos through civil grace, decency, and wit. With an introduction by Peter Conrad. <br><br></p></p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Study Guide for Pathophysiology</h2><p><p>Master the content from your textbook with this helpful study tool!

Sunday school curricula often glosses over difficult lessons or focuses too much on characters in Bible stories, neglecting God&#x2019;s self-revelation in Scripture. John and Kim Walton have created this handbook for 175 Bible stories to assist teachers and parents in knowing what each story teaches and how to present it in a God-centered way.</p><p>As they work their way through the Bible, the Waltons examine seven elements in each story: focus, theme, application, place in the Bible, interpretational issues, historical and cultural background, and age-group appropriateness. <em>The Bible Story Handbook</em> includes introductory articles on why we teach the Bible, right and wrong ways to use the Bible, and ends with a two-year teaching plan. Every parent and Sunday school teacher will find this unique resource to be invaluable in teaching children to know and love God.</p></p><p><p><strong>JOHN H.

John and Kim Walton provide welcome correction! The opening chapters show us the <em>real</em> reason for teaching Bible stories&#x2015;the revelation of God himself&#x2015;and the big picture of the Bible, into which all the individual stories must fit. Not only teachers of children but anyone who uses Bible stories to teach others should examine his or her use of narrative passages by the guidelines in this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Starr Meade,</strong> author, <em>Training Hearts, Teaching Minds</em>;<em> The Most Important Thing You&#x2019;ll Ever Study</em>; and <em>Give Them Truth</em></p><p>&#x201c;Wow! What a resource! The Waltons provide us with an invaluable tool for the person who teaches the Bible to anyone of any age in any context. The Waltons focus on the biblical story, keeping it God's story, making God the hero of every story, just as the original writers intended. This work is a gift to Sunday school teachers, curriculum writers, and parents who want informed, rich perspectives on the stories within the biblical metanarrative. The Introduction alone provides a vital background for reading the Scriptures. For a scholar like John, with his expertise in Old Testament studies, and someone with the experience of Kim to corroborate on a work of this magnitude is a timeless gift for the teaching ministries of the Church of Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Scottie May</strong>, Associate Professor of Christian Formation and Ministry, Wheaton College; coauthor, <em>Children Matter</em></p><p>&#x201c;Ted Ward once asserted that &#x2018;Christian education is neither.&#x2019; For generations, the church has outsourced responsibility for Bible learning and faith development to curriculum publishers. However, responsible publishers have never presumed that their material can be much more than introduction to the Bible. If Christian education is impoverished, the church, not the publisher, is responsible. This book looks like a curriculum. It is not. It is a description of a method, with abundant examples, that may assist congregations to become &#x2018;hermeneutical communities&#x2019; exercising responsible use of Scripture as they design learning experiences for the people of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Linda Cannell</strong>, Academic Dean, North Park Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;In an effort to make the bible relevant to children, too often curriculum writers and parents have focused on the wrong issue, which does violence to the text as they seek to make it relate to children. Bible scholar John Walton and his wife, Kim, have responded with this volume that speaks directly to the well-intentioned but nevertheless abusive use of the Bible, offering succinct insight into biblical stories, helping parents and teachers find the actual meaning of the text to enable responsible teaching. I highly recommend this excellent book for those who want to teach the Bible insightfully to children and to adults. They help us all to take the text seriously, letting it speak as God intended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Perry G. Downs,</strong> Professor Emeritus of Educational Ministries, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</p><p>&#x201c;All too often we who teach children have come to the Bible with an agenda. We come with a lesson in mind and then search for a Bible story that might be used as a sort of &#x2018;proof text&#x2019; for the lesson with nary a thought of the real intent of the passage. This is a wonderful resource for parents and teachers to help them remain true to the biblical text while providing valuable help in communicating truth to children. It can be used as a supplement to classroom curriculum or as a guide in teaching children in the home. I recommend this book to everyone who understands the importance of clearly and accurately communicating God&#x2019;s Word, especially to the youngest of God&#x2019;s family.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Diane Jordan</strong>, Director of Children's Ministry, College Church, Wheaton, IL</p></p><h2>Be Hopeful (1 Peter): How to Make the Best of Times Out of Your Worst of Times (The BE Series Commentary)</h2><p><p>"Hope is not a sedative; it is a shot of adrenaline, a blood transfusion."&nbsp; Through clever word pictures like this, best-selling author and former pastor Warren Wiersbe preaches the same message Peter preached so long ago.&nbsp; Turning each enlightening page, believers gain increasing confidence in true Hope, a God in whom they don't just <i>wish </i>for eternal life.&nbsp; In Scripture, <i>hope </i>means the promise of salvation for those who have accepted Him and His Son's death and resurrection.</p> <p> Christians who possess this hope and live as though they possess it will learn godly submission, holy living, and harmony with other believers.&nbsp; These qualities will prepare them for what Peter paints in his epistle as inevitable-suffering and persecution.&nbsp; Though Peter is writing to warn a people who would soon be under the tyranny of a heathen Roman emperor, some level of suffering will always be a part of the believers' journey.&nbsp; A time is soon coming when living the "comfortable" Christian life will be far more costly than the life willing to give up all.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Warren W.&nbsp;Wiersbe&nbsp;(1929&#x2013;2019)&nbsp;</b>was an internationally known Bible teacher, author, and conference speaker.

Not, in the twenty-first century, the spectre of communism, but the spectre of capitalism. Marx&#39;s prediction that the state would wither away of its own accord has proved inaccurate, and he did not foresee the tyrannies which have ruled large parts of the globe in his name. Indeed, he would have been appalled if he had witnessed them. But his analysis of the evils and dangers of raw capitalism is as correct now as when it was written, and some of his suggestions (progressive income tax, abolition of child labour, free education for all children) are now accepted with little question. In a world where capitalism is no longer held in check by fear of a communist alternative, The Communist Manifesto (with Socialism Utopian and Scientific, Engels&#39;s brief, clear exposition of Marxist thought) is essential reading. The Condition of the Working Class in England is Engels&#39;s first, and probably best-known, book. With Henry Mayhew&#39;s London Labour and the London Poor, it was and is the outstanding study of the working class in Victorian England.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>Studying Culture: A practical Introduction</h2><p>Fully revised and updated, this second edition is an ideal introduction for those who are new to the study of culture.

The book gathers together some of Harvey's best work on two of his central concerns: the relationship between geographical thought and political power as well as the capitalist production of space. In addition, he chips away at geography's pretenses of "scientific" neutrality and grounds spatial theory in social justice. Harvey also reflects on the work and careers of little-noticed or misrepresented figures in geography's intellectual history-Kant, Von Thï¿½nen, Humboldt, Lattimore, Hegel, Heidegger, Darwin, Malthus, Foucault and many others.</p><p><strong>David Harvey</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the City University of New York Graduate School. He was previously Professor of Geography at both the Johns Hopkins University and Oxford University. His books include <em>Explanation in Geography (1969)</em>, <em>Social Justice</em> <em>and the City (1973)</em>, <em>The Limits to Capital (1982)</em>, <em>The</em> <em>Urban Experience (1988)</em>, <em>The Condition of Postmodernity</em> <em>(1989)</em>, <em>Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference</em> <em>(1996)</em> and <em>Spaces of Hope (2000)</em>."David Harvey is one of geography's best-known social theorists and one of the most important voices on the academic left in the United States...at a time when the fashionable abstractions of hte bougrgeois left just do not seem cute anymore, Harvey's historical geographic materialist analysis offers a refreshingly real-and-imagined geography of radical hope.<br>TCRecord.org, Gregory Martin and Peter McLaren, both at UCLA."<br>"Spanning nearly three decades of work, this collection shows David Harvey as steadfast in his commitments while he keeps up with changing times.---Iris Young, University of Chicago."<br>"These wise reflections on intellectual movements and political battles of the recent past show why David Harvey has become such an impressive figure of contemporary social critique. His fierce intellectual independence and equally insistent moral decency illuminate a concern for social justice that is primarily economic but extends into every sphere. No other scholar of our day has delved so deeply into the powers of capital to remake space and time, or argued so persuasively to place these processes at the core of all social thought.---Sharon Zukin, author of The Cultures of Cities."<br>"Harvey delves deeply into the collective psyche of geography as a discipline and attacks long-held assumptions of scientific neutrality within it.... Most geographers may take much of this book as an indictment of their chosen field, but Harvey certainly gives us much to consider. Appropriate for larger public libraries and academic libraries.."<br>-John E. Dockall," Library Journal <br>"David Harvey has done more than anyone else to demonstrate the centrality of geographical space in theevolution of human society under capitalism. He has done so in a constant dialogue with Marx, aware of the need to confront not just Marx's strengths but his weaknesses. Written over twenty-five years, these essays are an invaluable source of ideas on how human geography shapes and is in turn shaped by capitalist development. The book provides an excellent introduction to Harvey's work: it is essential reading for those interested in creative reinterpretations of Marx and in the historical geography of capitalism globally and locally.---Giovanni Arrighi, author of The Long Twentieth Century."<br></p><h2>College Match: A Blueprint for Choosing the Best School for You</h2><p>College Match has been providing guidance and direction to students and parents on successfully navigating the college search process for over 27 years! Four assumptions guide the writing of College Match: 1. All students, regardless of grades or test scores, have colleges from which to choose. Now more than ever, great colleges are out there waiting to be found. Students merely need to seize the opportunity by taking the time to search. Through the use of College Match, along with proper guidance and support, students will find colleges where they can be successful. While it is true that admission to college has become more competitive in recent years, it is also true that the collegiate opportunities in the United States and around the world are limitless. 2. There is a sequence of steps that, if followed, will lead to solid, suitable college choices. College Match is organized around those steps. Systematically moving from one step to the next will lead to self-knowledge and college awareness. These awarenesses provide the foundation on which students should base their college choice. 3. The college choice process neither has to be, nor is, inherently stressful. Over the last several years, anxiety, even panic, about selecting a college has increased. Some of that stress comes from false assumptions about the nature of college admission. Once students and their families replace the quest for the best college with one focusing on the best-fit college, the level of tension is significantly reduced. While College Match covers both getting in and fitting in, it focuses on fitting in because Antonoff feels this should be the primary emphasis throughout the college selection process. Fitting in is the largest contributor to creating a good college experience. 4. Finding a college builds important, lifelong skills in taking initiative, making decisions, and assuming responsibility. College Match encourages students to take the lead in their college planning and to grow as a result. For many students, choosing a college is their first real-life choice. By making difficult decisions during the college choice process and accepting the consequences of their decisions, students gain not only self-understanding but also an understanding of how life works. This knowledge will stand them in good stead long after their college careers have ended.</p><p>For over 35 years, Steven R. Antonoff has built his knowledge of colleges and universities. That knowledge led to the creation of College Match. Dr. Antonoff has worked with more than 3,500 students and has visited (and revisited) hundreds of colleges. In addition to College Match, Dr. Antonoff is the author of The College Finder: Choosing the School That s Right for You. Now in its fourth edition, it was published by Wintergreen Orchard House. Since 1993, College Finder has been a go-to source for helping students and college counselors build college lists. Barron s Profiles of American Colleges has included Dr. Antonoff s article, Know Yourself, for almost 20 years. Dr. Antonoff is also the author of A Student of Colleges: Fundamentals of Independent Educational Consulting. The book is a textbook for college consultants including topics such as college affordability, building a college list, learning disabilities, counseling strategies, and acquisition of knowledge. A popular speaker and webinar presenter, Dr. Antonoff has covered a wide range of topics. Session titles include: Ranking the Academic Quality of Colleges, Parents and College Planning, Solving the College Admission Puzzle, College Shopping: Getting in and Fitting in, College Admission: Separating Fact from Fiction, and College Planning: De-stressing or Distressing? . Dr. Antonoff is an instructor and member of the advisory board for the certificate program in independent educational consulting through the University of California, Irvine (UCI). He previously taught college consulting courses through the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) college counseling program. Before becoming an independent educational consultant, Dr. Antonoff spent 11 years in college administration, serving as dean of admissions and financial aid, executive director of admissions and student affairs, and dean of students at the University of Denver.In a crowded field of college guides and resource books, College Match offers the best, most up to date, relevant advice. We have used College Match as a part of our College Counseling Advisory Class for the past six years. Our philosophy is for students to find the right fit and the book offers a clear blueprint to do so. --Gerard M. Brett, Director of College Counseling, La Salle College High School, Wyndmoor, PA<br><br>College Match is truly a blueprint from A-Z of the application process. From busting myths to insider tips and invaluable worksheets this small book is a gem. --Laila F Alamuddin, M.Ed., Certified Educational Planner, Senior Consultant, College Bound Consulting LLC, Hinsdale, Illinois<br><br>Every college-bound student should have this book.

The first volume appeared in 1878, just before Nietzsche abandoned his academic life. In 1886 it was republished, incorporating in a second volume two books of aphorisms which Nietzsche had published in the meantime. Subtitled &#39;A Book for Free Spirits&#39;, Human, All Too Human marked for Nietzsche a new &#39;positivism&#39; and scepticism with which he challenged his previous metaphysical and psychological assumptions. Nearly all the themes of his later work are displayed here with characteristic perceptiveness and honesty, it remains one of the works fundamental for an understanding of his thought.</p><p>Subtitled &#34;A Book for Free Spirits&#34;, this text marked a new &#34;positivism&#34; and scepticism for Nietzsche with which he challenged his previous metaphysical and psychological assumptions. It remains one of the fundamental works for an understanding of his thought.Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was a philosopher, poet, critic and the greatest German intellectual of the 19th century. He vastly influenced the fields of literature, theology, philosophy and psychology.</p><h2>The Lord Chandos Letter</h2><p>Hugo von Hoffmannsthal made his mark as a poet, as a playwright, and as the librettist for Richard Strauss&#x2019;s greatest operas, but he was no less accomplished as a writer of short, strangely evocative prose works. The atmospheric stories and sketches collected here&#x2014;fin-de-siï¿½cle fairy tales from the Vienna of Klimt and Freud, a number of them never before translated into English&#x2014;propel the reader into a shadowy world of uncanny fates and secret desires. An aristocrat from Paris in the plague years shares a single night of passion with an unknown woman; a cavalry sergeant meets his double on the battlefield; an orphaned man withdraws from the world with his four servants, each of whom has a mysterious power over his destiny.<br><br>The most influential of all of Hofmannsthal's writings is the title story, a fictional letter to the English philosopher Francis Bacon in which Lord Chandos explains why he is no longer able to write. The "Letter" not only symbolized Hofmannsthal's own turn away from poetry, it captured the psychological crisis of faith and language which was to define the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Hugo von Hofmannsthal</b> (1874&#x2013;1929), the poet, dramatist, essayist, and librettist, was raised in Vienna. The son of a banker, Hofmannsthal began to publish under the pseudonym Loris when he was only sixteen. Hofmannsthal&#x2019;s youth, talent, and precociousness made a splash at Cafï¿½ Griensteidl, the epicenter of literary Vienna; critic Hermann Bahr, in particular, was astounded that someone using the pseudonym of a &#x201c;well-groomed poodle&#x201d; and with the figure of a &#x201c;fine, slender pageboy&#x201d; could write such brilliant poetry and prose. In the following years Hofmannsthal wrote successful plays and verse influenced by the Symbolist movement. He befriended such critics and writers as Richard Beer-Hofmann, Gerhart Hauptmann, and Stefan George, for whose literary magazine he wrote. A trip to Paris in 1900 introduced him to Maurice Maeterlinck, Auguste Rodin, and Anatole France. Around that time, however, Hofmannsthal turned away from Symbolist poetry; his aesthetic crisis is recorded, in part, in his famous work from 1902, &#x201c;A Letter&#x201d; (often referred to in English as &#x201c;The Lord Chandos Letter&#x201d;), in which a young nobleman confronts the futility of language. Hofmannsthal began to work almost entirely for the stage and, in 1906, met and began to collaborate with Richard Strauss. Over the next twenty years, he produced librettos for such Strauss operas as&nbsp;<i>Der Rosenkavalier, Ariadne auf Naxos,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Die Frau ohne Schatten</i>. During World War I, Hofmannsthal worked for a propaganda agency of the War Ministry; towards the end of his life, he championed Austrian culture in the hope that art could save Europe from political violence. He died in 1929, days after his oldest son committed suicide.<br><br><b>John Banville</b> was born in Wexford, Ireland, in 1945.

(Loeb Classical Library No. 285)</h2><p><p>Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II.

From birth to age eight, when children become integrated into society through their education at school and at home, Early Childhood Education examines the education of this age group from its historical beginnings to the theories used then and today. The writings and research of philosophers such as Locke, psychologists such as Freud, and pioneers of early childhood education such as Frobel, are covered in this concise text. With lucid and engaging prose, Morgan delineates the beginnings of early childhood education and how it has become an important field of study in education today. This edition has been updated to include recent research and how current practices and culture affect the field today. Also included in this second edition is a new chapter about critical race theory and its implications on early childhood education.</p><p>Harry Morgan teaches child development, learning theory, and research at the University of West Georgia in Carrollton. An early advocate of early childhood education, his experiences include teaching at Bank Street College in New York City, and professorships at Ohio University and Syracuse University. He is a graduate of New York University, The University of Massachusetts, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Scholars and practitioners of early childhood education sometimes need reminders of how far the field of study has progressed in terms of general acceptance as a valid and actual body of knowledge. Further, we need to celebrate our identity and common culture. Morgan reminds us, in his personable and accessible way, of our shared historical and theoretical roots. His text highlights the contributions of women, social revolutionaries, immigrants, and other historically marginalized groups. Morgan's research and interpretations of history show the necessity of advocacy on behalf of <i>Early Childhood Education</i>. Indeed advocacy on behalf of the rights of women and children is at the heart of <i>Early Childhood Education</i>. This perspective is very timely and should bolster current political efforts on behalf of young children, their families, and the institutions in which they are educated. (Clover Simms Wright, California University of Pennsylvania)<br><br>Harry Morgan's book is a great read for those looking for a concise, thought-provoking book on the history and theoretical background of early childhood education. Morgan doesn't leave the reader in the past, but brings the reader to current policies and issues as well as considering trends for the future. (Linda K. Taylor, Ball State University)<br><br>Anyone wanting to learn more about the field of early childhood education &#x2013; how we have improved and how we can continue to improve in helping our children succeed &#x2013; will enjoy this book.

Kant's third critique &#x2014; after <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> and <i>Critique of Pure Reason </i>&#x2014; remains one of the most important works on human reason. The <i>Critique of Judgment</i> informs the very basis of modern aesthetics by establishing the almost universally accepted framework for debate of aesthetic issues.<br>As in his previous critiques, Kant seeks to establish <i>a priori </i>principles. The first part of this work addresses aesthetic sensibility. The human response to specific natural phenomena as beautiful, he asserts, is a recognition of nature's harmonious order that corresponds to a mental need for order. The critique's second half focuses on the apparent teleology in nature's design of organisms. The philosopher declares that the mind is predisposed to find purpose and order in nature, and this predisposition forms the main principle underlying all our judgments. Although this could be interpreted as an argument in favor of a creator, Kant insists that a supernatural dimension or the existence of God cannot be proven &#x2014; such considerations lie beyond the realm of reason, solely within the province of faith.</p><p>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was born in Konigsberg, Prussia, where he remained his entire life.

As we enter the year 2000, zero is once again making its presence felt. Nothing itself, it makes possible a myriad of calculations. Indeed, without zero mathematics as we know it would not exist. And without mathematics our understanding of the universe would be vastly impoverished. But where did this nothing, this hollow circle, come from? Who created it? And what, exactly, does it mean?<br> Robert Kaplan's <em>The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero</em> begins as a mystery story, taking us back to Sumerian times, and then to Greece and India, piecing together the way the idea of a symbol for nothing evolved. Kaplan shows us just how handicapped our ancestors were in trying to figure large sums without the aid of the zero. (Try multiplying CLXIV by XXIV). Remarkably, even the Greeks, mathematically brilliant as they were, didn't have a zero--or did they? We follow the trail to the East where, a millennium or two ago, Indian mathematicians took another crucial step. By treating zero for the first time like any other number, instead of a unique symbol, they allowed huge new leaps forward in computation, and also in our understanding of how mathematics itself works.<br> In the Middle Ages, this mathematical knowledge swept across western Europe via Arab traders. At first it was called "dangerous Saracen magic" and considered the Devil's work, but it wasn't long before merchants and bankers saw how handy this magic was, and used it to develop tools like double-entry bookkeeping. Zero quickly became an essential part of increasingly sophisticated equations, and with the invention of calculus, one could say it was a linchpin of the scientific revolution. And now even deeper layers of this thing that is nothing are coming to light: our computers speak only in zeros and ones, and modern mathematics shows that zero alone can be made to generate everything.<br>Robert Kaplan serves up all this history with immense zest and humor; his writing is full of anecdotes and asides, and quotations from Shakespeare to Wallace Stevens extend the book's context far beyond the scope of scientific specialists. For Kaplan, the history of zero is a lens for looking not only into the evolution of mathematics but into very nature of human thought. He points out how the history of mathematics is a process of recursive abstraction: how once a symbol is created to represent an idea, that symbol itself gives rise to new operations that in turn lead to new ideas. The beauty of mathematics is that even though we invent it, we seem to be discovering something that already exists.<br>The joy of that discovery shines from Kaplan's pages, as he ranges from Archimedes to Einstein, making fascinating connections between mathematical insights from every age and culture. A <em>tour de force</em> of science history, <em>The Nothing That Is</em> takes us through the hollow circle that leads to infinity.<br></p><p>The publisher says <i>The Nothing That Is</i> is "in the tradition" of Dava Sobel's bestselling <i>Longitude</i>, presumably because it is both lyrically written and underillustrated. It's more accurate to describe it as in the tradition of something old enough to have a tradition: the cabinet of curios, a natural history in the old sense.<p> Robert Kaplan is a mathematics teacher, and he organizes his cabinet around--nothing. How did we come to have a symbol for zero? Who used it first? Usually the invention (or discovery) of zero is given as occurring in India in about the year 600 CE. Kaplan gives much more shrift to Sumerian, Babylonian, and Greek experiments with abacuses, counting boards, positional notation, and abstract thought. He acknowledges that his approach will be controversial:</p><p> </p><blockquote>Haven't all our dots funneled back to India? Were zero and the variable not truly born here, twin offspring of sunya and what seems the singularly Indian understanding of vacancy as receptive? But like an hour-glass, the funnel opens out again and the dots stream down to ancient Greece.</blockquote><p> Kaplan's meditations on zero are not confined to its origin. He muses on the "zero of self," on infinitesimals, on the Mayan zero, and on the nothingness of suicide. Throughout, he shows "a sensuous delight in syllables," a love of words as well as numbers, that makes the book a feast for both halves of the brain. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><br><strong>Robert Kaplan</strong> has taught mathematics to people from six to sixty, most recently at Harvard University. In 1994, with his wife Ellen, he founded The Math Circle, a program, open to the public, for the enjoyment of pure mathematics. He has also taught Philosophy, Greek, German, Sanskrit, and Inspired Guessing.

BOMC.</p><p>Charles F. Stuckey is Frances and Thomas Dittmer Curator of Twentieth-Century Painting and Sculpture at The Art Institute of Chicago.Being the first American museum to acquire a Monet and now possessing a significant Monet collection, the Art Institute of Chicago is, not surprisingly, currently presenting the largest, most comprehensive retrospective of the artist's works ever staged. Distinguished art scholar and curator Stuckey has brought together from public and private collections worldwide works that represent every facet of the Impressionist painter's long career. In his introductory essay for this exhibition catalog, Stuckey points out gaps that exist in Monet scholarship, especially from the mid-1880s to the artist's death in 1926. A detailed, 71-page chronology including images of works by Monet's contemporaries, key Monet works not in the exhibition, and historical photographs underscores Monet's profound influence on modern art as well as art of the previous century. Above all, readers will luxuriate in the 161 magnificent full-color plates. Popular garden author Russell (Gardens of the Riviera, Rizzoli, 1994) highlights Monet's year-round horticultural talents and provides an ideal companion volume to the exhibition catalog. She traces Monet's purchase of the now-famous apple orchard site, his meticulous plans to convert Giverny to a natural, informal garden, and the recent, spectacular restoration. The nurseries from which Monet ordered water lilies and peonies, his "paintbox beds" for experimenting with colors, friendships with fellow gardeners Caillebotte and Clemenceau, and lively details of the day-to-day monumental maintenance chores combine with sumptuous color photographs of the restored garden, reproductions of paintings, and historical photographs to create a delightful publication. Monet's genius for using the garden as his canvas and immortalizing Giverny in impressionistic masterpieces is richly conveyed.

Thus begins this charming collaboration that gently encourages young readers to explore their natural surroundings and observe some of the more commonly found insects in it. In spare prose, brief facts about a variety of creatures, such as leaf-miner caterpillars, ground beetles, ants, earwigs, and dragonflies, are shared, as are hints on where and how to find them. Large print tells the main story with small print providing further details or interesting facts, giving an opportunity for deeper exploration. Simple but elegant pen and watercolor illustrations show the creatures in their habitats, going about their daily business. Shared aloud or read alone, this child-friendly title is a wonderful introduction to the insect world. Pair it with a wide variety of informational books to garner children's interest and excitement.&#x2014;<i>Jody Kopple, Shady Hill School, Cambridge, MA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Paideia, the shaping of Greek character through a union of civilization, tradition, literature, and philosophy is the basis for Jaeger's evaluation of Hellenic culture.<br>Volume I describes the foundation, growth, and crisis of Greek culture during the archaic and classical epochs, ending with the collapse of the Athenian empire. The second and third volumes of the work deal with the intellectual history of ancient Greece in the Age of Plato, the 4th century B.C.--the age in which Greece lost everything that is valued in this world--state, power, liberty--but still clung to the concept of paideia. As its last great poet, Menander summarized the primary role of this ideal in Greek culture when he said: "The possession which no one can take away from man is paideia."<br></p><p>The project of Greek culture in its heroic period was the creation of the perfect state-a goal that seemed within reach in the Athens of the fifth century B.C. But with the fall of Athens that prospect evaporated, and the result, which Werner Jaeger describes in this second volume of his magisterial three-volume study of Hellenism, was the spiritualizing of Greek culture-&#39;the search for the divine centre.&#39; Jaeger traces the growth of this new power in human culture from its early beginnings in the teachings of Socrates, to its natural climax in Plato&#39;s Republic.Werner Jaeger is formerly of Harvard University and the Institute for Classical Studies.</p><h2>Operating System Concepts</h2><p>If applicable, online access, codes or supplements are not d to be included or work.

A devout monastic, Tsongkhapa took on the difficult task of locating and studying all of the Indian Buddhist classics available in Tibet in his day. He went on to synthesize this knowledge into a holistic approach to the path of awakening. In an achievement of incredible magnitude, he integrated the pivotal yet disparate Mahayana teachings on emptiness while retaining the important role of critical reason and avoiding the extreme of negating the reality of the everyday world. <br><br> Included in this volume is a discussion of Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s early life and training; his emergence as a precociously intelligent Buddhist mind; the composition of his <i>Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment</i>, <i>Great Exposition of Tantra</i>, and many other important works; and his founding of the Lhasa Prayer Festival and Ganden Monastery. This is a necessary resource for anyone interested in Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s transformative effect on the understanding and practice of Buddhism in Tibet in his time and his continued influence today.</p><p>THUPTEN JINPA is a former monk and holds a Ph.D. from Cambridge University, where he also worked as a research fellow. Among other books, he is the author of <i>Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy: Tsongkhapa's Quest for the Middle Way</i>. Jinpa has been the principal English translator to H. H. the Dalai Lama for more than twenty-five years and has translated and edited numerous books by the Dalai Lama. Jinpa is an adjunct professor at the Faculty of Religious Studies at McGill University, Montreal, and Chairman of the Mind and Life Institute, which is dedicated to promoting dialogues and collaborations between the sciences and contemplative knowledge, especially Buddhism.&#x201c;Geshe Dr. Thupten Jinpa deserves the highest praise for this wonderful, groundbreaking biography of one of the greatest polymath geniuses of Tibet, the spiritual science master and social innovator Tsong Khapa Losang Drakpa (1357&#x2013;1419). Jinpa&#x2019;s scholarship in original sources is thorough and critical, yet not begrudging; his insight into the character and genius of this remarkable individual is penetrating; and his appreciation of the complex surrounding web of historical factors, personal relationships, and enduring institutions is revelatory. He transports us imaginatively into the unique and globally relevant world of Renaissance Tibet and grants us a vivid vision of the roots of the archetypically Buddhist civilization Tibet eventually attained. No one interested in understanding Buddhism, Tibet, and a previously little-known exemplary genius of the global renaissance of the fifteenth century should miss this pioneering work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert A. F. Thurman, Jey Tsong Khapa Professor Emeritus of Indo-Tibetan Buddhology, Columbia University<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In a most lively, yet highly informative and eye-opening manner, Thupten Jinpa offers us a definitive biography of one of the giants of Tibetan Buddhism. <i>Tsongkhapa: A Buddha in the Land of Snows </i>will be cherished as a classic in the world of biographies of great Tibetan masters.&#x201d;&#x2014;Matthieu Ricard, author of <i>Enlightened Vagabond: The Life and Teachings of Patrul Rinpoche</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;After the Buddha, no historical figure is more frequently represented in Tibetan art than Tsongkhapa. Yet, despite his fame, for centuries he has remained a two-dimensional figure on a Tibetan thangka. Until now. Drawing on a wealth of previously unstudied materials, many dating from Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s own lifetime, Thupten Jinpa transforms Tsongkhapa from a static icon into a complex and fascinating human being, his genius only heightened by his humanity.&#x201d;&#x2014;Donald Lopez, Distinguished University Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies, University of Michigan<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This extraordinary biography of Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Geluk school of Tibetan Buddhism, is a treasure house of history, as well as Tibetan thought and culture. Thupten Jinpa has made the life of this great master transparent to the contemporary reader and has brought into high relief Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s great teachings that have shown through the Geluk school for so many centuries.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joan Halifax, author of <i>Being with Dying </i>and <i>Standing at the Edge</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s extraordinary life made readable and inspiring. In these pages some of the most important roots of Tibetan Buddhism come alive, inviting our own wonder, learning, and appreciation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jack Kornfield, author of <i>The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As a practitioner who has been deeply touched and influenced by Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s teachings, it is uplifting and comforting to read a reliable biography, not a hagiography, that portrays this remarkable teacher as a human being like us&#x2014;someone who questions accepted views and seeks the truth, someone who changes their ideas and actions when presented with good reasons. Tsongkhapa was a true nonsectarian who learned from all great masters, no matter their affiliation. He was a genuine practitioner who succeeded in a challenge many of us face today: how to balance study, reflection, meditation practice, teaching, and activities that directly benefit others. He had a brilliant intellect but was humble, kind, and respectful. His open-mindedness and compassion are models for our behavior. Thupten Jinpa&#x2019;s respect and reverence for Tsongkhapa shine throughout the book, especially in his brilliant translations of portions of Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s texts and poetry.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thubten Chodron, author of <i>Guided Buddhist Meditations </i>and <i>How to Free Your Mind</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thupten Jinpa draws on his rigorous Tibetan scholarly training as well as his Cambridge education to offer an unprecedently human depiction of one of the greatest figures in Tibetan Buddhist literature. In a considerable departure from Tibetan tradition, Jinpa gives us a Tsongkhapa who is not an immutable icon but rather a person who developed through effort as well as favorable life circumstances. The story unfolds by intertwining Tsongkhapa&#x2019;s remarkable literary innovations with the political ups and downs that colored his life. Jinpa rightly describes his unique presentation as midway between Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201c;great man&#x201d; theory and Spencer&#x2019;s sense of <i>Zeitgeist</i>. He succeeds brilliantly in creating a truly modern biography, without diluting the rich flavor that comes from a cultural lens glowing with classic rigor and devotional regard. Everyone curious about Tibetan culture will delight in it. Scholars will make good use of the extensive notation, bibliography, and appendix.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anne Carolyn Klein, translator of <i>Strand of Jewels: My Teacher&#x2019;s Essential Guidance on Dzogchen</i> by Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche</p><h2>Art in China (Oxford History of Art)</h2><p>About the <em>Oxford History of Art</em> Series:<br> <br> "An impressively challenging and ambitious series intended to rewrite no less than the whole history of art in terms of new ideas and new scholarship."--Christopher White, Director of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford<br> <br> "A welcome introduction to art history for the twenty-first century....The best of the past and future."--Robert Rosenblum, <em>New York University</em><br> <br> The last twenty years have witnessed profound changes in art history, the greatest of which stem from the social and cultural perspectives now attached to art scholarship. Written by scholars at the forefront of new thinking, many of whom are rising stars in their fields, the <em>Oxford History of Art</em> series offers substantial and innovative texts that clarify, illuminate, and debate the critical issues at the heart of art history today. Providing a fresh new look at art that moves away from traditional elitist approaches, the series makes use of new research and methodologies, as well as newly accessible and non-canonical works to offer comprehensive coverage of the art world from archaic and classical Greek art to twentieth-century design and photography, from the artistry of African-American and Native North Americans to the masterpieces of Europe, Polynesia, and Micronesia. Lavishly illustrated and superbly designed, the <em>Oxford History of Art</em> brings new substance and verve to the exciting and ubiquitous world of art. <br><br> China boasts a history of art spanning 5,000 years and embracing a wide diversity of images and objects--from jade tablets, painted silk handscrolls and fans to ink and lacquer painting, porcelain-ware, sculpture, and calligraphy. But this rich tradition has not, until now, been fully appreciated in the West where scholars have focused their attention on sculpture, while largely ignoring those art forms most highly prized by the Chinese themselves, such as calligraphy. Now, in <em>Art in China</em>, Craig Clunas marks a breakthrough in the study of the subject. Taking into account all the arts practiced in China, and drawing on recent innovative scholarship, this rich text examines the production and consumption of art in its appropriate contexts. From art found in tombs to the state-controlled art of the Mao Zedong era, <em>Art in China</em> offers a novel look and comprehensive examination of all aspects of Chinese art.</p><p><br><strong>Craig Clunas</strong> is Senior Lecturer in Art History at the University of Sussex. His publications include <em>IFruitful States: Garden Culture in Ming Dynasty China</em>, <em>Chinese Export Art and Design</em>, and <em>chinese Export Watercolors</em>.<br>These two current overviews of Chinese art take very different approaches. Keeper of the Department of Eastern Art at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Tregear offers a chronologically organized work that covers its topic in brief survey form, using representative examples of bronzes, painting, laquerware, ceramics, jade, and stone carving. The book is so brief and the sweep is so broad that a reader not already familiar with the general outline of Chinese history and common Chinese terms may have trouble forming a coherent picture, particularly in regard to the earliest centuries covered. Significantly, Tregear leaves out the important find of a cache of figures at Shanxingdui in 1986, which has been of enormous importance in broadening the known range of cultures in ancient China. On the other hand, she provides an excellent section on 20th-century Chinese art, an area neglected by many of the standard histories. Clunas's (history of art, Univ. of Sussex) approach, by contrast, involves a more critical, theoretical inquiry into Western notions of Chinese art. He eschews a chronological arrangement in favor of thematic chapters on art at court, in the tomb, in the temple, in the life of the elite, and in the marketplace. He makes a point of including objects that have been considered masterpieces intermixed with other less well-known works. He is concerned throughout his text with issues of the historical place of art in Chinese society and with how that society evaluated various objects.

Its basic intentions coincide with what Guardini wanted to achieve. The only difference is that I have had to translate what Guardini did at the end of the First World War, in a totally different historical situation, into the context of our present-day questions, hopes, and dangers. Like Guardini, I am not attempting to involve myself with scholarly discussion and research. I am simply offering an aid to the understanding of the faith and to the right way to give the faith its central form of expression in the Liturgy." <br> <strong>- Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger</strong>, from the preface <p></p></p><p><strong>Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger</strong>, now Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, is the author of many acclaimed theological and spiritual works.

But recently, Nussbaum argues, thinking about the aims of education has gone disturbingly awry both in the United States and abroad. Anxiously focused on national economic growth, we increasingly treat education as though its primary goal were to teach students to be economically productive rather than to think critically and become knowledgeable and empathetic citizens. This shortsighted focus on profitable skills has eroded our ability to criticize authority, reduced our sympathy with the marginalized and different, and damaged our competence to deal with complex global problems. And the loss of these basic capacities jeopardizes the health of democracies and the hope of a decent world.</p><p> In response to this dire situation, Nussbaum argues that we must resist efforts to reduce education to a tool of the gross national product. Rather, we must work to reconnect education to the humanities in order to give students the capacity to be true democratic citizens of their countries and the world.</p><p> Drawing on the stories of troubling--and hopeful--educational developments from around the world, Nussbaum offers a manifesto that should be a rallying cry for anyone who cares about the deepest purposes of education.</p></p><p><p>"Martha Nussbaum is the most erudite and visionary scholar writing on higher education today. Once again, she has laid out a novel and compelling argument with all of the clarity and rigor we expect from her writing. <i>Not for Profit</i> reminds us all that the deeper purposes of liberal education go well beyond personal advancement or national competitiveness. The real project is to educate responsible global citizens who will champion democracy and human development, and who have the skills to collaborate across differences and borders to solve pressing global problems."<b>--Grant H. Cornwell, president of the College of Wooster</b></p><p>"This book could not be more timely nor more on target. Martha Nussbaum argues that education has become increasingly utilitarian, market-driven, career-oriented, and impoverished in its attention to the arts and humanities. The arts and humanities don't necessarily make people humane and creative, but they are, Nussbaum argues, required for Socratic examination and self-examination. If we agree with Socrates that the unexamined life is not worth living, then we need Nussbaum's argument."<b>--Peter Brooks, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This is an important book and a superb piece of writing, combining passionate enthusiasm with calm arguments and informative examples.

The material presented in the book is the result of years of effort and continual improvements, based on my observation of students&#39; performance, and the feedback received from students.The book is also written for instructors who want to switch to an agile software engineering approach. Software engineers and students who are puzzled by the problems faced in design, implementation and testing and who want to improve their OO development capabilities will find the book helpful. Finally, the book also devotes separate chapters for system engineering, software quality assurance, testing object-oriented and web applications, software maintenance, software configuration management, software project management, and software security.<b>PREFACE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Background </b><br> Computers are widely used in all sectors of our society, performing a variety of functions with the application software running on them. As a result, the market for software engineers is booming. The March 2006 issue of the Money Magazine ranked software engineer as the number 1 of the 50 best jobs in U.S. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 2010-2020 projections, the total number of jobs in application development software engineers and system analyst positions is expected to increase from 520,800 to 664,500 (27.6%) and from 544,400 to 664,800 (22.10%), respectively. To be able to perform the work required of an application development software engineer or systems analyst, an education in software engineering is highly desired. However, according to the data released by BLS ("Earned Awards and Degrees, by Field of Study, 2005-2006"), only 160 bachelor and 600 master's degrees in software engineering, and 10,289 bachelor and 4,512 master's degrees in computer science were awarded in 2006. Thus, there is a significant gap between the demand and supply, especially for graduates with a software engineering degree.<br> Many people do not know the scope and usefulness of software engineering as a practice, and the discipline is often misunderstood. Many media outlets seem to define software engineering as writing Java programs. Some students think that software engineering includes everything related to software. Others think that software engineering is drawing UML diagrams, as the following story illustrates. Several years ago, after the first class of an object-oriented software engineering (OOSE) course, a student said to me, "Professor, you know that this will be an easy course for me because we've drawn lots of UML diagrams before." At the end of the semester, the student came to me again and said, "Professor, I want to tell you that we had worked very hard but we learned a lot about OO design. It is not just drawing UML diagrams as I thought." So what is software engineering? As a discipline, it encompasses research, education and application of engineering processes, methodologies, quality assurance, and project management to significantly increase software productivity and software quality while reducing software cost and time to market.<br> OOSE is a branch of software engineering that is characterized by its view of the world as consisting of objects relating to and interacting with each other. The advent of the C++ programming language in the 1980s marked the beginning of the OOSE era. Since then, software production began its unprecedented world-wide growth and was further accelerated by the creation and world-wide adoption of the unified modeling language (UML) and the unified process (UP). Strictly speaking, a software process describes the phases and what should be done in each phase. It does not define (in detail) how to perform the activities in each phase. A modeling language, such as UML, defines the notations, syntax and semantics for communicating and documenting analysis and design ideas. UML and UP are good and necessary but not sufficient. This is because how to produce the analysis and design ideas required to draw meaningful UML diagrams is missing.<br> <b>Motivation </b><br> To fill the gaps discussed in the last paragraph, we need a methodology or a "cookbook." Unlike a process, a methodology is a detailed description of the steps and procedures or how to carry out the activities to the extent that a beginner can follow to produce and deploy the desired software system. Without a methodology, a beginning software engineer would have to spend a few years of on-job training to learn OO design, implementation and testing skills.<br> The writing of the book is also motivated by emerging interests in agile processes, design patterns and test driven development (TDD). Agile processes emphasize teamwork, design for change, rapid deployment of small increments of the software system, and joint development with the customer and users. Design patterns are effective design solutions to common design problems. Design patterns promote software reuse and improve team communication. TDD advocates testable software, requires test scripts to be produced before the implementation so that the latter can be tested immediately and frequently.<br> As an analogy, consider the development of an amusement park. The overall process includes the following phases: planning, public approval, analysis and design, financing, construction drawings, construction, procurement of equipment, installation of equipment, pre-opening, and grand opening. However, knowing the overall process is not enough. The development team must know how to perform the activities of the phases. For example, the planning activities include development of initial concept, feasibility study, and master plan generation. The theme park team must know how to perform these activities. The analysis and design activities include "requirements acquisition" from stakeholders, site investigation, design of park layout, design of theming for different areas of the park, creating models to study the layout design and theming, and producing the master design. Again, the theme park team must know how to perform these activities to produce the master design. Unlike a process that describes the phases of activities, a methodology details the steps and procedures or how to perform the activities.<br> The development of an amusement park is a multi-year project and costs billions of dollars. The investor wants the park to generate revenue as early as possible; but with the above process, the investor has to wait until the entire park is completed. Once the master design is finalized, it cannot be modified easily due to the restrictions imposed by the conventional process. If the park does not meet the expectations of the stakeholders, then changes are costly once the park is completed.<br> Agile processes are aimed to solve these problems. With an agile process, a list of preliminary theme park requirements is acquired quickly and allowed to evolve during the development process. The amusement and entertainment facilities are then derived from the requirements and carefully grouped into clusters of facilities. A plan to develop and deploy the clusters in relatively short periods of time is produced --- that is, rapid deployment of small increments. Thus, instead of a finalized master design, the development process designs and deploys one cluster at a time. As the clusters of facilities are deployed and operational, feedback is sought and changes to the requirements, the development plan, budget and schedule are worked out with the stakeholders --- that is, joint development. In addition, the application of architectural design patterns improves quality and ability of the park to adapt to changing needs --- that is, design for change. Teamwork is emphasized because effective collaboration and coordination between the teams and team members ensure that the facilities will be developed and deployed timely and seamlessly.&nbsp; The agile process has a number of merits. The investor can reap the benefits much earlier because the facilities are operational as early as desired and feasible. Since a small number of the facilities is developed and deployed at a time, errors can be corrected and changes can be made more easily.<br> In summary, ... <br> Audiences,&nbsp;Organization, and&nbsp;Acknowledgment are omitted due to limit on space.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Big Green Book of Italian Verbs</h2><p><p><b>A colorful addition to the popular Big Book of Verbs series</b></p> <p>What does <i>The Big Green Book of Italian Verbs </i>have that the competition doesn't?

It is expertly put together by a kidney donor, who is a registered nurse, and her mom, the recipient of her kidney. Together, they have taken their knowledge and experience to create a resource for all those suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). By explaining how kidney function is impacted by the foods we eat, they offer a simple way for patients to help slow down, stop, or possibly reverse the many effects of CKD&#x2015;including heart disease, the number one killer of kidney patients. The vital information provided in <i><strong>Smoothies for Kidney Health</strong>, </i>along with eighty luscious smoothie recipes, is designed to offer help to all patients at any stage of CKD.</p> <p>After presenting readers with a basic summary of kidney functions, the book &nbsp;explains the relationship between our standard diet choices and the ever-growing epidemic of CKD&#x2015;as well as each of its common causes. Utilizing and referencing the most current research studies, the book clearly shows how certain foods can speed deterioration of kidney function, resulting in dialysis and early death. The book then discusses how to prevent or slow progression of CKD by altering diet, again supported by the most current research studies and footnoted.&nbsp; These sections also were reviewed and approved by a leading nephrologist and a cardiologist.&nbsp;</p> <p>Following these explanation sections are eighty (80) kitchen-tested smoothies containing the very ingredients scientifically shown to protect and improve kidney function. &nbsp;Each recipe includes hepful health promoting facts designed for the issues facing kidney patients.&nbsp; All renal diet smoothies are renal dietitian reviewed and approved.</p> <p>The recipes are divided into three sections to allow readers to select those recipes most appropriate for their stage of CKD. Section One highlights the key ingredients that can help slow CKD progression, lower proteinuria, eliminate acidosis, decrease uric acid levels, and otherwise aid the health of the kidneys and the kidney patient. The second section is designed for individuals who must alter their intake of potassium and/or phosphorus because of the inability of their malfunctioning kidneys to stabilized blood levels of those minerals. The last section provides dialysis patients smoothies with a focus is on heart health, improving stamina and survival, and minimizing common dialysis side effects. The reader will also find valuable suggestions throughout the book that will help kidney patient deal with their most common problems at each stage.</p> <p>Once a diagnosis is made, kidney patients often want to know what they can do to improve their condition. &nbsp;The basic food suggestions offered in this book are within a patient's control in what is otherwise an uncontrollable and devastating disease. <strong><i>Smoothies for Kidney Health</i></strong> offers the hope and the help to aid kidney patients become part of the solution to improving their overall health.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><i>Victoria L. Hulett, JD, </i>received her undergraduate degree from Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, with majors in Biology and Psychology;&nbsp; her Master&#x2019;s Degree&nbsp; from St. Francis Universaty, summa cum laude, and her Juris Doctorate degree from Indiana University School of Law, magna cum laude.&nbsp;Vicki taught in high school and college before obtaining her law degree and has received numerous recognitions and honors as a lawyer.</p><p>If you or a loved one has recently learned that you have chronic kidney disease, we know that you are going through a difficult time. Fortunately, as you will find in the pages that follow, by modifying your diet, you can do a great deal to not only help protect kidney function but also improve your overall health. Better yet, you can actually make your diet more pleasurable by adding foods that are a delight to eat. This book will show you how it&#x2019;s done. </p> <p>The idea for this book took root several years ago, when Vicki received a devastating diagnosis of Alport Syndrome, a genetic condition that causes chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the doctors stated that nothing could slow the progression of the disease, our research showed that good dietary choices and exercise could help protect the kidneys. Both of us began following a kidney-protective, heart-protective diet with wonderful results. Although the doctors had predicted that Vicki would need a transplant or dialysis within three years, it was six years before her kidneys failed, and during that time, she remained energetic and able to work full-time. At that point, Jennifer insisted on giving her mom one of her own kidneys. Surgery was easy for both of us, and recovery was fast. Afterwards, we continued our kidney-protective diet.</p> <p>What was distinctive about the diet we adopted? In addition to cutting out red meat and reducing the consumption of other meat, sugar, and processed foods, which place a burden on the kidneys, we added lots of fruits, vegetables, and other foods that can slow or stop the progression of CKD. We found that the easiest and most delicious way to incorporate these health-building foods in our diet was with smoothies. No other nutritious meal or snack can be made from scratch in only a couple of minutes, and none provides health-enhancing benefits in such a concentrated form. These one-mug wonders became one of the mainstays of our diet. They allowed us to maintain our busy schedules and keep involved in life while enjoying great taste. </p> <p>However, <strong><em>Smoothies for Kidney Health</em></strong> is more than a cookbook. It is also designed to help you understand both kidney function and kidney disease, and guide you in making smart lifestyle choices that can prolong the health of your kidneys and heart. </p> <p>Part One of the book focuses on the kidneys, their function and their dysfunction. Chapter 1 begins by reviewing the important tasks performed by the kidneys. It also discusses the common and often avoidable causes of CKD and the natural decline in kidney function that occurs as you age, as well as the partnership between heart and kidney disease. </p> <p>Chapter 2 explores the connection between CKD and diet. While CKD can have several causes, nearly 80 percent of all cases are the result of eating too much of the foods that contribute to type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity&#x2015;common disorders that can lead to kidney disease. Chapter 2 ends with a discussion of whether we are setting our children up for CKD by establishing poor dietary habits.</p> <p>As you may already know, food choices directly impact kidney function. Based on the latest studies, Part Two further explores the connection between good food and good kidney and heart health.</p> <p>Chapter 3 first discusses the best diet for preserving kidney function and then examines the components of this diet that have healing properties. As you&#x2019;ll see, antioxidants, phytochemicals, and fiber&#x2015;found in whole fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and seeds&#x2015;are natural disease fighters. (And what&#x2019;s the easiest way to get these nutritional superheroes on your side? Smoothies!)</p> <p>If you&#x2019;re already suffering some of the disturbing symptoms of kidney malfunction&#x2015;acidosis and imbalances in potassium and phosphorus, for instance&#x2015;you&#x2019;ll probably want to learn how appropriate food choices can help alleviate these specific problems. That&#x2019;s the focus of Chapter 4. An inset presents guidelines for people who still have some kidney function and want to preserve it, and a special section addresses people who have received kidney transplants and want to optimize the health and survival of their new kidney. </p> <p>By the time you reach Part Three, you&#x2019;ll be ready for serious smoothie making. After Chapter 5 answers the question, &#x201c;Why Smoothies?,&#x201d; Chapter 6 provides valuable advice on choosing your smoothie ingredients and achieving blending success. Then, the remaining chapters present eighty delicious symptom-relieving smoothie recipes. The recipes have been divided into three groups to accommodate individuals who are at different stages of CKD and have altered dietary requirements.</p> <p>Chapter 7 includes forty-five smoothies for people who wish to avoid CKD, or who already have this disorder and want to slow or even halt its progression. The ingredients in these recipes are designed to help lower proteinuria; decrease blood pressure; reduce creatinine levels and estimated GFR (markers of CKD progression); and reduce acidosis, uric acid levels, and internal inflammation. </p> <p>Chapter 8 offers fifteen smoothies for people with more advanced CKD who must reduce their intake of phosphorus and potassium. At this point, individuals often struggle with food choices. The smoothies in this section make it easy to prepare delicious meals that support the kidneys and promote heart health. </p> <p>Chapter 9 includes twenty smoothie recipes for people on dialysis who have substantially restricted dietary requirements. These smoothies also offer soothing relief from several of the common complications of dialysis. </p> <p>Every recipe in <strong><em>Smoothies for Kidney Health</em></strong> is presented in a way that not only makes it easy to prepare a luscious meal <em>without cooking</em>, but also highlights that smoothie&#x2019;s unique benefits. Each recipe begins by explaining how its carefully chosen ingredients contribute to kidney health and, in many cases, alleviate specific conditions like high blood pressure. Then, after giving simple-to-follow directions, it offers a tidbit of useful information about the kidneys and the foods that protect them. Finally, it presents Nutrient Values per serving, including calories, fat, fiber, protein, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and calcium. This enables you to choose those smoothies that are in line with the dietary guidelines provided by your doctor or renal dietitian. Needless to say, these recipes emphasize fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, and nuts and seeds&#x2015;the foods that place the smallest burden on kidney function and are best for heart health and weight control. </p> <p>A delicious, produce-filled smoothie is a powerful way to take control of your health every day.

After the reforms of King Josiah and Prophet Jeremiah, the religion recognized Yahweh alone, and history was rewritten to make it appear that it had always been that way. The worship of Asherah and other goddesses was now heresy, and so the status of women was downgraded and they were blamed for God&#x2019;s wrath. <br><br>However, as Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince reveal, the spiritual legacy of the Jewish goddesses and the Sacred Feminine lives on. Drawing on historical research, they examine how goddess worship thrived in early Judaism and included a pantheon of goddesses. They share new evidence for an earlier form of Hebrew worship that prayed to both male and female gods, including a 20th-century archaeological discovery of a Hebrew temple dedicated to both Yahweh and the goddess Anat. Uncovering the Sacred Feminine in early Christianity, the authors show how, in the first century AD, both Jesus and his great rival, Simon Magus, were attempting to restore the goddess-worshipping religion of the Israelites. The authors reveal how both men accorded great honor to the women they adored and who traveled with them as priestesses, Jesus&#x2019;s Mary Magdalene and Simon&#x2019;s Helen. But, as had happened centuries before, the Church rewrote history to erase the feminine side of the faith, deliberately ignoring Jesus&#x2019;s real message and again condemning women to marginalization and worse. <br><br>Providing all the necessary evidence to restore the goddess to both Judaism and Christianity, Picknett and Prince expose the disastrous consequences of the suppression of the feminine from these two great religions and reveal how we have been collectively and instinctively craving the return of the Sacred Feminine for millennia.</p><p>Since 1989, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince have researched historical and religious mysteries, authoring such bestsellers as <i>The Stargate Conspiracy</i> and <i>The Templar Revelation</i>, which directly inspired <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>.

Lynn lives in Surrey, UK, and Clive lives in London.<b>Chapter Two. The Divine Consort</b> <br><br>In 1967 a ground-breaking book by the Hungarian-born American professor of anthropology Raphael Patai was published. <i>The Hebrew Goddess</i> presented landmark evidence for female forms of the divine - what is now known as the sacred feminine - in various Judaic traditions. Soberly, it set out to show that, despite the traditional presentation of the Jewish God as unwaveringly male, the expression of female divinity had always been present in Judaism. <br><br>Although concentrating on Judaism from the last centuries BCE to the Middle Ages, Patai&#x2019;s book opened with the status of <i>goddesses</i> in ancient Israel and the era of the kingdoms - a startling, often even shocking concept in the 60s, and which still has the potential to unsettle even now. Since then, however, many of his conclusions and speculations, based on a close reading of the Hebrew Bible and comparisons to other religions, have been vindicated by archeological and other discoveries. We personally owe him a great debt, for he opened our eyes to what is, of course, to most believers, a complete shake-up of Jewish religious history. <i>Goddesses - in Judaism?</i> <br><br>This was obviously potentially explosive stuff, but - as frequently happens with radical challenges to the academic Establishment - at the time it sank almost without trace. Few other biblical scholars or archeologists acknowledged Patai&#x2019;s prescience. He is rarely mentioned, even today.<br><br>Yet, as we hope to prove, not only was Patai spot on about the very existence of a Hebrew goddess, but that she also had a thriving, proud priesthood dedicated solely to her worship... <br><br><b><i>The Jealous God</i></b><br><br>In the Hebrew Bible, when discussing the Israelites&#x2019; &#x201c;backsliding&#x201d; to the worship of other gods, the word <i>asherah</i> occurs some 40 times, sometimes in conjunction with Baal. Clearly this refers to a deity at the center of some highly dubious cult, at least as far as the writers were concerned. A feminine noun, sometimes it appears to refer to an object, often in the plural, <i>asherim</i>, and sometimes seems to be simply a female name, but always it&#x2019;s intimately associated with devotion, even adoration, of a forbidden sort. It&#x2019;s not a huge leap to conclude that <i>asherah</i> was a feminine deity, and one who was worshiped by &#x201c;heretics&#x201d; in ancient Israel.<br><br>Was this Asherah really a Hebrew <i>goddess</i>? Was her cult truly, as the Bible makes out, heretical? Or are the books of the Old Testament really covering up some secret revelations about the Sacred Feminine? And what relationship, if any, did this Asherah have with that most male of gods, Yahweh? Piecing together the evidence, often tiny bit by tiny bit, she emerges as a startlingly important lady... <br><br>The first mention of her in the Hebrew Bible is in Exodus, when Yahweh makes his covenant with Moses on Mount Sinai. God commands the Israelites that when he&#x2019;s driven the Canaanites out of the Promised Land, &#x201c;You shall tear down their altars and break their pillars and cut down their Asherim (for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God).&#x201d; (2) Cutting down &#x201c;Asherahs&#x201d; implies she was symbolized as objects. <br><br>Similar injunctions appear in Deuteronomy, the final laying down of the Law, allegedly by Moses, including one not to &#x201c;plant any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the LORD that you shall make.&#x201d;(3) So &#x201c;an Asherah&#x201d; is, or can be, a tree. The fact that such a practice had to be prohibited suggests that setting up an Asherah tree next to altars to Yahweh was a popular tradition. Clearly, Asherah, whoever she was, was a threat to the &#x201c;Yahweh alone&#x201d; movement - his influential hardcore devotees - as late as King Josiah&#x2019;s day. As William Dever asks rhetorically, &#x201c;why would later reforming priests and prophets condemn these things so vociferously<i> unless they remained popular</i> in Israelite religion?&#x201d;(4) <br><br>But why are we only discovering the truth about Asherah worship now? Why has it taken millennia for the Hebrew goddess to be acknowledged? <br><br>When the Hebrew Bible was first translated into Greek, Latin and English the meaning of the word asherah was unknown. Because of its association with sacred places and trees, the 2nd-century BCE Greek Septuagint translated asherim as &#x201c;groves,&#x201d; which passed into the Latin Vulgate and then into other translations such as the King James Version &#x2013; and onwards into every Protestant denomination. As far as the average church-goer was concerned, if they even noticed the relevant passages, they shrugged them off. Who cares about some weird tree fixation? And there the matter rested for over 2000 years. <br><br>The puzzle was finally solved in 1929, during excavations of the ancient Canaanite city of Ugarit - modern Ras Shamra - on Syria&#x2019;s Mediterranean coast. In the ruins of the Temples of El and Baal they unearthed hundreds of clay tablets dating from the 14th century BCE that depicted their myths. Naturally many of them referred to the Canaanites&#x2019; supreme god, El, but there was something else... A previously unknown goddess appeared alongside the great god El: Asherah, the supreme female deity of all Canaanite deities. <br><br>So far from being literally made of leafy stuff, <i>asherah</i> turns out to be that most unexpected of beings, a Canaanite goddess. Her existence certainly explains the Bible&#x2019;s charges of apostasy back in the old days, while there were pockets of Canaanites still around. And it explains why she was paired with Baal, and why the Hebrew Bible repeatedly warns the Israelites off her worship, just as it did with Baal&#x2019;s.</p><h2>Confessions of a Real Estate Entrepreneur: What It Takes to Win in High-Stakes Commercial Real Estate: What it Takes to Win in High-Stakes Commercial Real Estate</h2><p><p> <b>A front row seat into the world of high-stakes commercial real estate investing</b> </p> <p> <i> &#x201c;A must-read book ... one of the best real estate investment books I have ever read.

Later it reviews the Riemann integral and the basic properties of derivatives, offering a sound construction of the so called elementary functions.

His books include <i>Ayurvedic Massage, Tools for Tantra, The Healing Cuisine, Leela: The Game of Self-Knowledge, Numerology, Numerologia, The Healing Power of Gemstones</i> and <i>Breath, Mind, and Consciousness.</i> He has produced several audiocassettes, including <i>Sounds of the Chakras, Sounds of Tantra, Chants to the Sun and Moon</i> and <i>Attunements for Dawn and Dusk.</i>A beautifully crafted book.

It also debunks common myths about Silicon Valley, one of the world's most influential but least-understood places. Far more than any label of the moment, the devil of racism has long been Silicon Valley's defining force, and Stephen Pitti argues that ethnic Mexicans--rather than computer programmers--should take center stage in any contemporary discussion of the "new West."</p><br><p> Pitti weaves together the experiences of disparate residents--early Spanish-Mexican settlers, Gold Rush miners, farmworkers transplanted from Texas, Chicano movement activists, and late-twentieth-century musicians--to offer a broad reevaluation of the American West. Based on dozens of oral histories as well as unprecedented archival research, <i>The Devil in Silicon Valley</i> shows how San Josï¿½, Santa Clara, and other northern California locales played a critical role in the ongoing development of Latino politics.</p><br><p> This is a transnational history. In addition to considering the past efforts of immigrant and U.S.-born miners, fruit cannery workers, and janitors at high-tech firms--many of whom retained strong ties to Mexico--Pitti describes the work of such well-known Valley residents as Cï¿½sar Chavez. He also chronicles the violent opposition ethnic Mexicans have faced in Santa Clara Valley. In the process, he reinterprets not only California history but the Latino political tradition and the story of American labor.</p><br><p> This book follows California race relations from the Franciscan missions to the Gold Rush, from the New Almaden mine standoff to the Apple janitorial strike. As the first sustained account of Northern California's Mexican American history, it challenges conventional thinking and tells a fascinating story. Bringing the past to bear on the present, <i>The Devil in Silicon Valley</i> is counter-history at its best.</p></p><p><p>"Set in a valley of immense wealth and extensive poverty, Stephen Pitti's expansive history of Latinos in the San Jose region stretches across a vast period of history, highlighting both the enormous contribution of Mexican-origin people to the area's economy, culture, and political development and the 'devil of discrimination' that has shaped growth in the Silicon Valley from the beginning. A masterful accomplishment!"<b>--George Sanchez, University of Southern California.</b></p><p>"Vestiges of the Devil in the form of historical racist ideologies and social inequalities from California's Spanish, Mexican, and American periods stubbornly persist in today's Silicon Valley. Stephen Pitti presents the seldom-told and hard-to-find causes of this dark and sometimes violent and discriminatory side of Silicon Valley's history, describing its continuing detrimental effects on its old and still emerging Latino population, which has been left behind again in the latest wave of economic success."<b>--Fernando R. Zazueta, Founding Chairman of the Board, Mexican Heritage Corporation of San Jose</b></p><p>"<i>The Devil in Silicon Valley</i> is a beautiful piece of work--sweeping narrative, compelling argumentation, and crisp writing throughout. Pitti demonstrates how San Josï¿½ is simultaneously central and peripheral to the main currents of Chicano/mexicano history. He helps readers make sense of why Mexicans were racialized in specific ways at specific times. And he adds new insight into the variety of ways ethnic Mexicans identify themselves and organize. This is an outstanding book."<b>--David Gutierrez, author of <i>Between Two Worlds</i></b></p><b>Stephen J.

In<i> Being There</i>, Andy Clark weaves these several threads into a pleasing whole and goes on to address foundational questions concerning the new tools and techniques needed to make sense of the emerging sciences of the embodied mind. Clark brings together ideas and techniques from robotics, neuroscience, infant psychology, and artificial intelligence. He addresses a broad range of adaptive behaviors, from cockroach locomotion to the role of linguistic artifacts in higher-level thought.</p></p><p>The old opposition of matter versus mind stubbornly persists in the way we study mind and brain. In treating cognition as problem solving, Andy Clark suggests, we may often abstract too far from the very body and world in which our brains evolved to guide us. Whereas the mental has been treated as a realm that is distinct from the body and the world, Clark forcefully attests that a key to understanding brains is to see them as controllers of embodied activity. From this paradigm shift he advances the construction of a cognitive science of the embodied mind.Andy Clark is Doctor of Philosophy at the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences at the University of Sussex.</p><h2>Bede: Ecclesiastical History, Books IV-V. Lives of the Abbots. Letter to Egbert. (Loeb Classical Library No. 248) (Volume II)</h2><p><p>Bede 'the Venerable,' English theologian and historian, was born in 672 or 673 CE in the territory of the single monastery at Wearmouth and Jarrow. He was ordained deacon (691&#x2013;2) and priest (702&#x2013;3) of the monastery, where his whole life was spent in devotion, choral singing, study, teaching, discussion, and writing. Besides Latin he knew Greek and possibly Hebrew.</p><p>Bede's theological works were chiefly commentaries, mostly allegorical in method, based with acknowledgment on Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose, Gregory, and others, but bearing his own personality. In another class were works on grammar and one on natural phenomena; special interest in the vexed question of Easter led him to write about the calendar and chronology. But his most admired production is his <i>Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation</i>. Here a clear and simple style united with descriptive powers to produce an elegant work, and the facts diligently collected from good sources make it a valuable account.

Alone or as a set, these classic compendiums are powerful tools that clinicians and researchers alike will find an invaluable addition to - or update of - their libraries.<br> <br> Giving clinicians the scales they need to measure their clients' problems and monitor their outcomes, these all-in-one sourcebooks bring effective, accountable practice within reach for today's busy professionals.</p><p>Joel Fischer is a Professor of Social Work at the University of Hawaii. Kevin Corcoran is a Professor of Social Work at Portland State University."...[Corcoran and Fischer] continue with their extraordinarily successful endeavor which enables practitioners to choose the most appropriate measurement instrument for problems they encounter in a matter of minutes. This book should be on the shelf of every practitioner working in a human<br>service setting. Through the use of this book, practitioners will not only continue to meet the ever increasing demands for accountability, but will also satisfy their own desires for objective quantifiable indications of progress in a manner that can be accomplished in no more than several<br>minutes. As I predicted twenty years ago, 'the value of this book will increase', and that continues to be the case."--From the new Foreword by David H. Barlow, Ph.D., ABPP, Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry and Director of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston<br>University<br><br>"The fourth edition of Measures for Clinical Practice and Research will, like the earlier ones, be the "go-to" book on the shelf of practitioners and researchers. Fischer and Corcoran provide an invaluable resource to those needing access to reliable and valid tools when working with clients<br>or developing research studies. Laid out in an understandable format with cross-indexed items, users will find these volumes easy to navigate. A great addition to your personal library. You will not lend this book without obtaining significant collateral from the borrower!"-- David Miller, Ph.D.,<br>M.S.W., M.P.H. Associate Professor, Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences Case Western Reserve University<br><br>"For many years, the earlier edition of Fischer and Corcoran's Measures for Clinical Practice and Research occupied a treasured place on my office bookshelf. They were the most frequently borrowed books I possessed and several occasions my copies failed to be returned, a rough indicator of<br>their interest and value! The fourth edition is newly expanded, with a clinically useful overview of the principles measurement applied to practice issues, and a terrific new cross-index, linking together various measures by problem area, not only by clientele (individual, couple, family or<br>children). I love this two volume set of pencil and paper measures useful in assessing clients and in evaluating treatment outcomes. It is one of the handiest tools I have in teaching practice, assessment, and evaluation research. Every agency must keep a copy on its bookshelf! Every practitioner<br>will find it useful!"-- Bruce A. Thyer, Ph.D., Professor of Social Work, Florida State University<br><br>"All you need for counseling is a box of tissues, a clock, and this collection of instruments. After a few years in practice you can do without the clock, but the Measures for Clinical Practice and Research will still be useful. Here are convenient tools for assessment and documentation that<br>can address concerns about outcomes and accountability. Keep this book (and the tissues) close to hand."-- Bentson McFarland, MD, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry, Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University<br><br>"Once again, Joel Fischer and Kevin Corcoran have compiled an extremely helpful resource not only for practitioners but for researchers as well. In cogent chapters written in an accessible style, readers are provided with just the information they need to make intelligent and<br>empirically-grounded choices about measurement instruments. Earlier editions of Measures for Clinical Practice sit in a prominent place on my office bookshelf, and I find myself consulting them often. Drs. Fischer and Corcoran have provided an important service for our field."-- Peter Salovey,<br>PhD, Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology, Dean of Yale College, Yale University</p><h2>Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments: A Stone Reader</h2><p><p><strong>From the editors of the widely influential <em>The Stone Reader</em> comes the most thorough and engaging guide to modern ethical thought available.</strong></p> Since 2010, <em>The Stone</em>&#x2015; an enormously popular column in the <em>New York Times</em>&#x2015; has interpreted and reinterpreted age-old inquires that speak to our contemporary condition.

Even more important, he succeeded in never wavering from coaching his way, from a place of deep values. Jackson was tagged as the &#x201c;Zen master&#x201d; half in jest by sportswriters, but the nickname speaks to an important truth: this is a coach who inspired, not goaded; who led by awakening and challenging the better angels of his players&#x2019; nature, not their egos, fear, or greed.<br><br> This is the story of a preacher&#x2019;s kid from North Dakota who grew up to be one of the most innovative leaders of our time. In his quest to reinvent himself, Jackson explored everything from humanistic psychology and Native American philosophy to Zen meditation. In the process, he developed a new approach to leadership based on freedom, authenticity, and selfless teamwork that turned the hypercompetitive world of professional sports on its head.<br><br> In <i>Eleven Rings</i>, Jackson candidly describes how he: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp; Learned the secrets of mindfulness and team chemistry while playing for the champion New York Knicks in the 1970s <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp; Managed Michael Jordan, the greatest player in the world, and got him to embrace selflessness, even if it meant losing a scoring title <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp; Forged successful teams out of players of varying abilities by getting them to trust one another and perform in sync <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp; Inspired Dennis Rodman and other &#x201c;uncoachable&#x201d; personalities to devote themselves to something larger than themselves <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp; Transformed Kobe Bryant from a rebellious teenager into a mature leader of a championship team. <br><br> Eleven times, Jackson led his teams to the ultimate goal: the NBA championship&#x2014;six times with the Chicago Bulls and five times with the Los Angeles Lakers. We all know the legendary stars on those teams, or think we do. What<i> Eleven Rings</i> shows us, however, is that when it comes to the most important lessons, we don&#x2019;t know very much at all. This book is full of revelations: about fascinating personalities and their drive to win; about the wellsprings of motivation and competition at the highest levels; and about what it takes to bring out the best in ourselves and others.</p><p>PHIL JACKSON is arguably the greatest coach in the history of the NBA. His reputation was established as head coach of the Chicago Bulls from 1989-1998; during his tenure, Chicago won six NBA titles. His next team, the Los Angeles Lakers, won five NBA titles, from 2000 to 2010. He holds the record for the most championships in NBA history as a player and a head coach. He also has the highest winning percentage of any NBA coach (.704). Jackson was a player on the 1970 and 1973 NBA champion New York Knicks. In 2007 Jackson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. <br><br>A former editor for <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and <i>People,</i> HUGH DELEHANTY is the co-author with Phil Jackson of the bestselling memoir, <i>Sacred Hoops</i>.<p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>THE CIRCLE OF LOVE</p><p>Life is a journey. Time is a river. The door is ajar.</p><p>JIM BUTCHER</p><p>Cecil B. DeMille would have loved this moment.</p><p>Here I was sitting in a limo at the ramp leading into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, waiting for my team to arrive, while an ecstatic crowd of ninety-five thousand plus fans, dressed in every possible combination of Lakers purple and gold, marched into the stadium. Women in tutus, men in <i>Star Wars</i> storm-trooper costumes, toddlers waving &#x201c;Kobe Diem&#x201d; signs. Yet despite all the zaniness, there was something inspiring about this ancient ritual with a decidedly L.A. twist. As Jeff Weiss, a writer for <i>LA Weekly</i>, put it: &#x201c;It was the closest any of us will ever know what it was like to watch the Roman Legions returning home after a tour of Gaul.&#x201d;</p><p>Truth be told, I&#x2019;ve never really felt that comfortable at victory celebrations, which is strange given my chosen profession. First of all, I&#x2019;m phobic about large crowds. It doesn&#x2019;t bother me during games, but it can make me queasy in less controlled situations. I&#x2019;ve also never really loved being the center of attention. Perhaps it&#x2019;s my inherent shyness or the conflicting messages I got as a kid from my parents, who were both ministers. In their view, winning was fine&#x2014;in fact, my mother was one of the most fiercely competitive people I&#x2019;ve ever met&#x2014;but reveling in your own success was considered an insult to God. Or as they would say, &#x201c;The glory belongs to Him.&#x201d;</p><p>This celebration wasn&#x2019;t about me, though. It was about the remarkable transformation the players had undergone en route to the 2009 NBA championship. You could see it in their faces as they descended the long purple and gold staircase into the coliseum dressed in rally caps and championship T-shirts, laughing, jostling, beaming with joy, while the crowd roared with delight. Four years earlier the Lakers hadn&#x2019;t even made the playoffs. Now they were masters of the basketball universe. Some coaches are obsessed with winning trophies; others like to see their faces on TV. What moves me is watching young men bond together and tap into the magic that arises when they focus&#x2014;with their whole heart and soul&#x2014;on something greater than themselves. Once you&#x2019;ve experienced that, it&#x2019;s something you never forget.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The symbol is the ring.</p><p>In the NBA, rings symbolize status and power. No matter how gaudy or cumbersome a championship ring may be, the dream of winning one is what motivates players to put themselves through the trials of a long NBA season. Jerry Krause, the former general manager of the Chicago Bulls, understood this. When I joined the team as an assistant coach in 1987, he asked me to wear one of the two championship rings I&#x2019;d earned playing for the New York Knicks as a way to inspire the young Bulls players. This is something I used to do during the playoffs when I was a coach in the Continental Basketball Association, but the idea of sporting such a big chunk of bling on my finger every day seemed a bit much. One month into Jerry&#x2019;s grand experiment the ring&#x2019;s centerpiece rock fell out while I was dining at Bennigan&#x2019;s in Chicago, and it was never recovered. After that I went back to wearing the rings only during the playoffs and on special occasions like this triumphant gathering at the coliseum.</p><p>On a psychological level, the ring symbolizes something profound: the quest of the self to find harmony, connection, and wholeness. In Native American culture, for instance, the unifying power of the circle was so meaningful that whole nations were conceived as a series of interconnected rings (or hoops). The tepee was a ring, as were the campfire, the village, and the layout of the nation itself&#x2014;circles within circles, having no beginning or end.</p><p>Most of the players weren&#x2019;t that familiar with Native American psychology, but they understood intuitively the deeper meaning of the ring. Early in the season, the players had created a chant they would shout before each game, their hands joined together in a circle.</p><p>One, two, three&#x2014;RING!</p><p>After the players had taken their places on the stage&#x2014;the Lakers&#x2019; portable basketball court from the Staples Center&#x2014;I stood and addressed the crowd. &#x201c;What was our motto on this team? The ring,&#x201d; I said, flashing my ring from the last championship we won, in 2002. &#x201c;The ring. That was the motto. It&#x2019;s not just the band of gold. It&#x2019;s the circle that&#x2019;s made a bond between all these players. A great love for one another.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Circle of love.</i></p><p>That&#x2019;s not the way most basketball fans think of their sport. But after more than forty years involved in the game at the highest level, both as a player and as a coach, I can&#x2019;t think of a truer phrase to describe the mysterious alchemy that joins players together and unites them in pursuit of the impossible.</p><p>Obviously, we&#x2019;re not talking romantic love here or even brotherly love in the traditional Christian sense. The best analogy I can think of is the intense emotional connection that great warriors experience in the heat of battle.</p><p>Several years ago journalist Sebastian Junger embedded himself with a platoon of American soldiers stationed in one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan to learn what enabled these incredibly brave young men to fight in such horrifying conditions. What he discovered, as chronicled in his book <i>War</i>, was that the courage needed to engage in battle was indistinguishable from love. Because of the strong brotherhood the soldiers had formed, they were more concerned about what happened to their buddies than about what happened to themselves. Junger recalls one soldier telling him that he would throw himself on a grenade for any one of his platoonmates, even those he didn&#x2019;t like all that much. When Junger asked why, the soldier replied, &#x201c;Because I actually love my brothers. I mean, it&#x2019;s a brotherhood. Being able to save their life so they can live, I think is rewarding. Any of them would do it for me.&#x201d;</p><p>That kind of bond, which is virtually impossible to replicate in civilian life, is critical to success, says Junger, because without it nothing else is possible.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to take the analogy too far. Basketball players don&#x2019;t risk their lives every day like soldiers in Afghanistan, but in many ways the same principle applies. It takes a number of critical factors to win an NBA championship, including the right mix of talent, creativity, intelligence, toughness, and, of course, luck. But if a team doesn&#x2019;t have the most essential ingredient&#x2014;love&#x2014;none of those other factors matter.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Building that kind of consciousness doesn&#x2019;t happen overnight. It takes years of nurturing to get young athletes to step outside their egos and fully engage in a group experience. The NBA is not exactly the friendliest environment for teaching selflessness. Even though the game itself is a five-person sport, the culture surrounding it celebrates egoistic behavior and stresses individual achievement over team bonding.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t the case when I started playing for the Knicks in 1967. In those days most players were paid modestly and had to take part-time jobs in the summer to make ends meet. The games were rarely televised and none of us had ever heard of a highlight reel, let alone Twitter. That shifted in the 1980s, fueled in large part by the popularity of the Magic Johnson&#x2013;Larry Bird rivalry and the emergence of Michael Jordan as a global phenomenon. Today the game has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry, with fans all over the world and a sophisticated media machine that broadcasts everything that happens on and off the court, 24-7. The unfortunate by-product of all this is a marketing-driven obsession with superstardom that strokes the egos of a handful of ballplayers and plays havoc with the very thing that attracts most people to basketball in the first place: the inherent beauty of the game.</p><p>Like most championship NBA teams, the 2008&#x2013;09 Lakers had struggled for years to make the transition from a disconnected, ego-driven team to a unified, selfless one. They weren&#x2019;t the most transcendent team I&#x2019;d ever coached; that honor belongs to the 1995&#x2013;96 Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Nor were they as talented as the 1999&#x2013;2000 Lakers team, which was loaded with clutch shooters including Shaquille O&#x2019;Neal, Kobe Bryant, Glen Rice, Robert Horry, Rick Fox, and Derek Fisher. But the 2008&#x2013;09 Lakers had the seeds of greatness in their collective DNA.</p><p>The players looked hungrier than ever when they showed up for training camp in August 2008. At the end of the previous season, they&#x2019;d made a miraculous run to the finals against the Celtics, only to be humiliated in Boston and lose the decisive game 6 by 39 points. Clearly the beating we&#x2019;d received at the hands of Kevin Garnett and company&#x2014;not to mention the torturous ride to our hotel afterward through mobs of Celtics fans&#x2014;had been a brutal experience, especially for the younger players who hadn&#x2019;t tasted Boston venom before.</p><p>Some teams get demoralized after losses like that, but this young, spirited team was energized by getting so close to the prize only to have it batted away by a tougher, more physically intimidating opponent. Kobe, who had been named the NBA&#x2019;s most valuable player that year, was particularly laser focused. I&#x2019;ve always been impressed by Kobe&#x2019;s resilience and ironclad self-confidence. Unlike Shaq, who was often plagued by self-doubt, Kobe never let such thoughts cross his mind. If someone set the bar at ten feet, he&#x2019;d jump eleven, even if no one had ever done it before. That&#x2019;s the attitude he brought with him when he arrived at training camp that fall, and it had a powerful impact on his teammates.</p><p>Still, what surprised me the most was not Kobe&#x2019;s ruthless determination but his changing relationship with his teammates. Gone was the brash young man who was so consumed with being the best player ever that he sucked the joy out of the game for everyone else. The new Kobe who had emerged during the season took his role as team leader to heart. Years ago, when I&#x2019;d first arrived in L.A., I&#x2019;d encouraged Kobe to spend time with his teammates instead of hiding out in his hotel room studying videotape. But he&#x2019;d scoffed at the idea, claiming that all those guys were interested in were cars and women. Now he was making an effort to connect more closely with his teammates and figure out how to forge them into a more cohesive team.</p><p>Of course, it helped that the team&#x2019;s other cocaptain&#x2014;Derek Fisher&#x2014;was a natural leader with exceptional emotional intelligence and finely tuned management skills. I was pleased when Fish, who had played a key role as a point guard during our earlier run of three consecutive championships, decided to return to L.A. after free-agent gigs with the Golden State Warriors and the Utah Jazz. Though Fish wasn&#x2019;t as quick or as inventive as some of the younger point guards in the league, he was strong, determined, and fearless, with a rock-solid character. And despite his lack of speed, he had a gift for pushing the ball up court and making our offense run properly. He was also an excellent three-point shooter when the clock was running down. Most of all, he and Kobe had a solid bond. Kobe respected Derek&#x2019;s mental discipline and dependability under pressure, and Derek knew how to get through to Kobe in a way that nobody else could.</p><p>Kobe and Fish kicked off the first day of training camp with a speech about how the upcoming season would be a marathon, not a sprint, and how we needed to focus on meeting force with force and not allowing ourselves to be intimidated by physical pressure. Ironically, Kobe was beginning to sound more and more like me every day.</p><p>In their groundbreaking book, <i>Tribal Leadership</i>, management consultants Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright lay out the five stages of tribal development, which they formulated after conducting extensive research on small to midsize organizations. Although basketball teams are not officially tribes, they share many of the same characteristics and develop along much the same lines:</p><p><b>STAGE 1</b>&#x2014;shared by most street gangs and characterized by despair, hostility, and the collective belief that &#x201c;life sucks.&#x201d;</p><p><b>STAGE 2</b>&#x2014;filled primarily with apathetic people who perceive themselves as victims and who are passively antagonistic, with the mind-set that &#x201c;my life sucks.&#x201d; Think <i>The Office</i> on TV or the <i>Dilbert</i> comic strip.</p><p><b>STAGE 3</b>&#x2014;focused primarily on individual achievement and driven by the motto &#x201c;I&#x2019;m great (and you&#x2019;re not).&#x201d; According to the authors, people in organizations at this stage &#x201c;have to win, and for them winning is personal. They&#x2019;ll outwork and outthink their competitors on an individual basis. The mood that results is a collection of &#x2018;lone warriors.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p><b>STAGE 4</b>&#x2014;dedicated to tribal pride and the overriding conviction that &#x201c;we&#x2019;re great (and they&#x2019;re not).&#x201d; This kind of team requires a strong adversary, and the bigger the foe, the more powerful the tribe.</p><p><b>STAGE 5</b>&#x2014;a rare stage characterized by a sense of innocent wonder and the strong belief that &#x201c;life is great.&#x201d; (See Bulls, Chicago, 1995&#x2013;98.)</p><p>All things being equal, contend Logan and his colleagues, a stage 5 culture will outperform a stage 4 culture, which will outperform a 3, and so on. In addition, the rules change when you move from one culture to another. That&#x2019;s why the so-called universal principles that appear in most leadership textbooks rarely hold up. In order to shift a culture from one stage to the next, you need to find the levers that are appropriate for that particular stage in the group&#x2019;s development.</p><p>During the 2008&#x2013;09 season the Lakers needed to shift from a stage 3 team to a stage 4 in order to win. The key was getting a critical mass of players to buy into a more selfless approach to the game. I didn&#x2019;t worry so much about Kobe, even though he could go on a shooting spree at any second if he felt frustrated. Still, by this point in his career I knew he understood the folly of trying to score every time he got his hands on the ball. Nor was I concerned about Fish or Pau Gasol, who were naturally inclined to be team players. What concerned me most were some of the younger players eager to make a name for themselves with the ESPN <i>SportsCenter</i> crowd.</p><p>But to my surprise, early in the season I noticed that even some of the most immature players on the team were focused and single-minded. &#x201c;We were on a serious mission, and there wasn&#x2019;t going to be any letup,&#x201d; says forward Luke Walton. &#x201c;By the time we got to the finals, losing just wasn&#x2019;t going to be an option.&#x201d;</p><p>We got off to a roaring start, winning twenty-one of our first twenty-five games, and by the time we faced the Celtics at home on Christmas, we were a far more spirited team than we&#x2019;d been during the previous year&#x2019;s playoffs. We were playing the game the way the &#x201c;basketball gods&#x201d; had ordained: reading defenses on the move and reacting in unison like a finely tuned jazz combo.

You see, the first few times I baked it, I found the texture a little too dry. I revamped the recipe adding more brown sugar and replacing butter with oil. It turned out to be one of the best pound cake decisions in the world! The result is one intensely rich cake with a tight, dense crumb. The vanilla and chocolate batters are made from the same brown sugar base, so it&#x2019;s an easy dessert to throw together. My favorite part is cutting into that first slice and unveiling the beautiful chocolate swirls!</p> <p><b></b></p><b>Directions</b><p></p> <p>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350ï¿½F (180ï¿½C, or gas mark 4). Spray a 9 x 5 inch (23 x 13 cm) loaf pan with non-stick spray. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until combined. Whisk in the milk, oil, vanilla, and vanilla seeds. Set aside. In a large bowl, toss the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Do not overmix. Remove 1 cup of the batter and pour into a small bowl. Stir in the cocoa powder. Pour one-third of the vanilla batter into the prepared loaf pan. Spoon 1&#x2215;3 of the chocolate batter on top. Repeat until both batters are gone. Gently swirl a large knife through the batter, making rounded horizontal zig-zags from one side of the pan to the other. Wipe the excess batter from the knife. Repeat the swirling pattern in the opposite direction. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the cake with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The loaf is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out practically clean with only a few moist crumbs. Remove from the oven and allow the cake to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack before removing and slicing. The cake will stay fresh, covered, at room temperature for up to 4 days.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>Prep time: 15 minutes - Total time: 1 hour, 35 minutes - Makes: 1 pound cake</p> <br> <p><b></b></p><b>Ingredients</b><p></p> <ul><li>4 eggs</li><li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li><li>1 cup (200 g) light brown sugar</li><li>1 cup (240 ml) milk</li><li>1 cup (240 ml) vegetable oil</li><li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract seeds scraped from ï¿½ vanilla bean</li><li>2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour</li><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>ï¿½ teaspoon salt</li><li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li></ul><p>No one knows sweet like Sally!

Based around a series of sermons by Andrew Murray, Absolute Surrender extols the need for &#34;absolute surrender&#34; to God. Murray provides concrete steps for bringing about such surrender in one&#39;s life. He also describes both the fruit of surrendering, e.g. true experience of the Holy Spirit in one&#39;s life, and the different &#34;stages&#34; one goes through on the &#34;path to Christian liberty.&#34; Thus, anyone not fully experiencing Christian liberty can profit from reading this book, either in a group Bible study or simply in personal study. Full of insight, Absolute Surrender is a timeless devotional that will aid every believer in surrendering to Christ.&#34; Tim Perrine</p><p>Andrew Murray (1828 1917) was a South African writer, teacher, and Christian pastor. Murray considered missions to be &#34;the chief end of the church.&#34; Andrew pastored churches in Bloemfontein, Worcester, Cape Town and Wellington, all in South Africa. He was a champion of the South African Revival of 1860. In 1889, he was one of the founders of the South African General Mission (SAGM), along with Martha Osborn and Spencer Walton. After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission&#39;s name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with SIM in 1998 and continues to this day. He died on January 18, 1917, four months before his eighty-ninth birthday. Over the years he has influenced many, including Jessie Penn-Lewis, a key figure in the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival.</p><h2>Duck &amp; Goose Go to the Beach</h2><p><b>Take a trip to the beach with the beloved, classic, and&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling odd couple Duck &amp; Goose!<br><br></b>Duck wants to go on an adventure. But Goose isn't so sure. Together, the two best friends set off on a walk that takes them through the meadow, past a shady thicket, and over a distant hill, all the way to a place they've never been before&#x2014;the beach!

In this, their tenth go-round, they&#x2019;re both happily at rest in a butterfly-dotted meadow until Goose says, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s never leave.&#x201d; To which, of course, Duck responds, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s leave,&#x201d; racing off. Goose is very reluctant to move and keeps up a constant argument about the wisdom of just staying put. Duck manages to get them both to the beach, and in a nifty reversal, it&#x2019;s Goose who now reigns, reveling in the waves, the new creatures they meet, and the seashell-filled tidal pool, while Duck just gets his feathers ruffled by everything. Hills&#x2019; illustrations are rendered in bright oil paints that capture meadow and sea with equal vivacity. Duck and Goose, of course, are their usual comically at-odds selves, this time nicely illustrating the benefits of both adventurous and cautious personalities.

He's an absolute cheat and quite the sore loser as well. But when Pig challenges his foot-long playmate, Trevor, to a kibble eating contest, he accidentally stuffs more than just food in his mouth. Lucky for Pig, Trevor knows what to do and saves the day!<br><br>Young readers will love Blabey's irresistibly quirky illustrations that are paired with a relatable lesson about learning to play nice. For dog and pet lovers everywhere.</p><p>Aaron Blabey has written many well-loved, bestselling books for children. He is the creator of three hugely successful series for children -- the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <b>The Bad Guys</b>, <b>Pig the Pug</b>, and <b>Thelma the Unicorn</b>. In 2018 it was announced that a movie adaptation of <b>The Bad Guys</b> is in development at DreamWorks Animation with Aaron serving as an executive producer on the project. Aaron's books have won many awards, including nine REAL Awards, an INDIE Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, a Children's Book Council of Australia -- Book of the Year Award, a NSW Premiers Literary Award for Children's Literature, two Australian Book Design Awards, and a Children's Peace Literature Award.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Fans of Pig the Pug will enjoy this follow-up story about this feisty pup. This time around, Pig has to win at everything. Even if it's not a competition, the pug turns it into one. Whether by cheating or throwing a temper tantrum, Pig must be declared the winner. His attitude begins to affect his friendship with Trevor the dachshund. One night, while the two are having dinner, Pig declares an eating competition. Thinking only of winning, Pig eats so fast that he swallows his bowl. It's a good thing Trevor is there to give him the Heimlich maneuver and save his life. Instead of a thank you though, Pig yells "I won!" just as the flying bowl bounces back and bops him on the head. In the end, viewers see Pig with a bandaged head, who is more at ease with the idea of losing&#x2014;sometimes. Cartoon illustrations of this expressive bug-eyed-pug bring Pig's eccentric character to life. Readers are guaranteed to either love or hate him, but will definitely not feel indifferent. Minimal background allows the characters to really carry the story. VERDICT The important lesson of playing fair and winning (and losing) gracefully is one that everyone should learn, and who better than Pig to teach it? A great addition for storytime collections.&#x2014;Emily E.

It&#x2019;s not preachy or judgmental, and has a sweet story about friendship first and foremost.

With laugh-aloud humor, Homer outwits and outruns a colorful assortment of civil War-era thieves, scallywags, and spies as he makes his way south, following clues that finally lead him to the Battle of Gettysburg and the dramatic story of the 20th Maine at Little Round Top.

Philbrick divides his time between Maine/NH and Florida. Visit him at rodmanphilbrick.com.Slavery, injustice, and Civil War battles suggest serious historical fiction. But Philbrick handles these subjects with a measure of folksy humor, which is greatly enhanced by William Dufris&#39;s exquisite sense of timing and irony. Orphaned Homer is a boy with a storytelling gift. Dufris&#39;s verve makes his tall tales even more colorful. When Homer&#39;s cruel uncle sells his underage brother into the Union Army, Homer&#39;s off to the rescue. His travels lead to nonstop adventures with a string of vivid characters--from slimy slave-catchers Stink and Smelt to the shifty Professor Fleabottom.

Visit Peter at PeterHReynolds.com.One day I counted your fingers and kissed each one," opens McGhee's (<i>A Very Brave Witch</i>) understated yet emotion-charged expression of a mother's love and hopes for her child. Reynolds's (<i>The Dot</i>) spare, wispy pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations depict the narrator and her daughter sharing everyday moments that mark milestones in the girl's maturation: the mother watches snowflakes "melt on your baby skin" and crosses the street as her little one grasps her hand. A transitional spread first reveals the youngster on a tricycle, aided by her mother, and then riding solo on a bicycle ("Then, you were my baby,/ and now you are my child"). Quietly the emotion builds, as the mother thinks of the future in store for her daughter, its joys and sorrows: "Someday I will stand on this porch and watch your arms waving to me until I no longer see you." Here Reynolds depicts the woman, older than she was at the book's start, on the left, gazing forlornly across the white expanse of the spread. The narrative comes full circle, as the parent looks ahead to a day, "a long time from now," when her daughter's own hair will "glow silver in the sun." Handlettering by Reynolds augments the story's deeply personal quality, which will resonate with both new and seasoned mothers.

He would ask for silence, which he never received on the first request. After counting to three, he would bring this yardstick up over his head and smack it down on the desktop in such a way that it would break in two. The free half would fly up into the air behind him, hit the blackboard, and clatter to the floor. Then, in the audible silence to follow, he would say, simply, &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; And he&#x2019;d have no trouble with the class after that.<br> <br>Reuben warned him that someday a piece would fly in the wrong direction and hit a student, causing a world of problems, but it had always worked as planned, so far as he knew.<br> <br>&#x201c;It boils down to unpredictability,&#x201d; Lou explained. &#x201c;Once they see you as unpredictable, you hold the cards.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he asked what Reuben did to quiet an unfamiliar and unruly class, and Reuben replied that he had never experienced the problem; he had never been greeted by anything but stony silence and was never assumed to be predictable.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Right,&#x201d; Lou said, as if he should have known better.<br> <br>And he should have.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Reuben stood before them, for the first time, both grateful for and resentful of their silence. Outside the windows on his right was California, a place he&#x2019;d never been before. The trees were different; the sky did not say winter as it had when he&#x2019;d started the long drive from Cincinnati. He wouldn&#x2019;t say from home, because it was not his home, not really. And neither was this. And he&#x2019;d grown tired of feeling like a stranger.<br> <br>He performed a quick head count, seats per row, number of rows. &#x201c;Since I can see you&#x2019;re all here,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;we will dispense with the roll call.&#x201d;<br> <br>It seemed to break a spell, that he spoke, and the students shifted a bit, made eye contact with one another. Whispered across aisles. Neither better nor worse than usual. He turned away to write his name on the board. Mr. St. Clair. Also wrote it out underneath, Saint Clair, as an aid to pronunciation. Then he paused before turning back, so they would have time to finish reading his name.<br> <br>In his mind, his plan, he thought he&#x2019;d start right off with the assignment. But it caved from under him, like skidding down the side of a sand dune. He was not Lou, and sometimes people needed to know him first. Sometimes he was startling enough on his own, before his ideas even showed themselves.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we should spend this first day,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;just talking. Since you don&#x2019;t know me at all. We can start by talking about appearances. How we feel about people because of how they look. There are no rules. You can say anything you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>Apparently, they did not believe him yet, because they said the same things they might have with their parents looking on. To his disappointment.<br> <br>Then, in what he supposed was an attempt at humor, a boy in the back row asked if he was a pirate.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;m a teacher.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought only pirates wore eye patches.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;People who have lost eyes wear eye patches. Whether they are pirates or not is beside the point.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The class filed out, to his relief, and he looked up to see a boy standing in front of his desk. A thin white boy, but very dark haired, possibly part Hispanic, who said, &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened to your face?&#x201d;<br> <br>Reuben smiled, which was rare for him, being self-conscious about the lopsided effect. He pulled a chair around so the boy could sit facing him and motioned for him to sit, which he did without hesitation. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Trevor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Trevor what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;McKinney. Did I hurt your feelings?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Trevor. You didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My mom says I shouldn&#x2019;t ask people things like that, because it might hurt their feelings. She says you should act like you didn&#x2019;t notice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what your mom doesn&#x2019;t know, Trevor, because she&#x2019;s never been in my shoes, is that if you act like you didn&#x2019;t notice, I still know that you did. And then it feels strange that we can&#x2019;t talk about it when we&#x2019;re both thinking about it. Know what I mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think so. So, what happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was injured in a war.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Vietnam?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My daddy was in Vietnam. He says it&#x2019;s a nightmare.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would tend to agree. Even though I was there for only seven weeks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My daddy was there two years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Was he injured?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe a little. I think he has a sore knee.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was supposed to stay two years, but I got hurt so badly that I had to come home. So, in a way, I was lucky that I didn&#x2019;t have to stay, and in a way, your daddy was lucky because he didn&#x2019;t get hurt that badly. If you know what I mean.&#x201d; The boy didn&#x2019;t look too sure that he did. &#x201c;Maybe someday I&#x2019;ll meet your dad. Maybe on parents&#x2019; night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. We don&#x2019;t know where he is. What&#x2019;s under the eye patch?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can it be nothing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like nothing was ever there. Do you want to see?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You bet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Reuben took off the patch.<br> <br>No one seemed to know quite what he meant by &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; until they saw it. No one seemed prepared for the shock of &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; where there would be an eye on everyone else they had ever met. The boy&#x2019;s head rocked back a little, then he nodded. Kids were easier. Reuben replaced the patch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry about your face. But, you know, it&#x2019;s only just that one side. The other side looks real good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Trevor. I think you are the first person to offer me that compliment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, see ya.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good-bye, Trevor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Reuben moved to the window and looked out over the front lawn. Watched students clump and talk and run on the grass, until Trevor appeared, trotting down the front steps.<br> <br>It was ingrained in Reuben to defend this moment, and he could not have returned to his desk if he&#x2019;d tried. He needed to know if Trevor would run up to the other boys to flaunt his new knowledge. To collect on any bets or tell any tales, which Reuben would not hear, only imagine from his second-floor perch, his face flushing under the imagined words. But Trevor trotted past the boys without so much as a glance, stopping to speak to no one.<br> <br>It was almost time for Reuben&#x2019;s second class to arrive. So he had to get started, preparing himself to do it all over again.<br> <br>From The Other Faces Behind the Movement by Chris Chandler<br> <br>Reuben<br> <br>There is nothing monstrous or grotesque about my face. I get to state this with a certain objectivity, being perhaps the only one capable of such. I am the only one used to seeing it, because I am the only one who dares, with the help of a shaving mirror, to openly stare.<br> <br>I have undergone eleven operations, all in all, to repair what was, at one time, unsightly damage. The area that was my left eye, and the lost bone and muscle under cheek and brow, have been neatly covered with skin removed from my thigh. I have endured numerous skin grafts and plastic surgeries. Only a few of these were necessary for health or function. Most were intended to make me an easier individual to meet. The final result is a smooth, complete absence of an eye, as if one had never existed; a great loss of muscle and mass in cheek and neck; and obvious nerve damage to the left corner of my mouth. It is dead, so to speak, and droops. But after many years of speech therapy, my speech is fairly easily understood.<br> <br>So, in a sense, it is not what people see in my face that disturbs them, but rather what they expect to see and do not.<br> <br>I also have minimal use of my left arm, which is foreshortened and thin from lack of use, and I am deaf in one ear. My guess is that people rarely notice this until I&#x2019;ve been around awhile, because my face tends to steal the show.<br> <br>I have worked in schools, lounged in staff rooms, where a Band-Aid draws comment and requires explanation. &#x201c;Richie, what did you do to your hand?&#x201d; A cast on an arm becomes a story told for six weeks, multiplied by the number of employees. &#x201c;Well, I was on a ladder, see, preparing to clean my storm drains. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>So it seems odd to me that no one will ask. If they suddenly did, and I were forced to repeat the story, I might decide I liked things better before. But it&#x2019;s not so much that they don&#x2019;t ask, but why they don&#x2019;t ask, as if I am an unspeakable tragedy, as new and shocking to myself as to them.</p><h2>The Big Book of Serial Killers Volume 2: Another 150 Serial Killer Files of the World&#39;s Worst Murderers (An Encyclopedia of Serial Killers)</h2><p><p><strong>Our first volume caused such an impact that we&#x2019;ve decided to bring you the long-awaited Volume 2 of the most comprehensive Serial Killer encyclopedia ever published!</strong></p><p>Murderers or monsters, normal people turned bad or people born with the desire to kill; it doesn&#x2019;t matter where they come from, serial killers strike dread into our hearts with a single mention of their names.
